All that we have is our **time** and **attention**, a human's most valuable, irreplaceable assets. It's all an aging parent desires from their kids[^1], and all the Eternal Father desires that we reciprocate. Where we pour our time and attention reveals where our heart lies[^2].

Time isn't money, though it can be directed to make money. Time and attention are resources, and we devote them to whatever is important to us. It would be more accurate to say that *time is love*.

Given these limited resources, it is worth running an audit on our routines and reflecting on where we want to invest our precious time and attention. What has my heart? What do I desire? Take any valuable thing, and ask, what does it cost, and can I afford it?

### reflection
First and foremost,

1. To console the Heart of God and become a great saint.

All else to attain falls under the desire for God Himself, which costs everything and I must try every day to afford. All other to attain of the lovely things of creation identified are done so by discernment:

2. Holiness. *Realize, who is God calling me to become?*
	In itself, this takes time and attention to free the heart *from* competing desires in order to free the heart *for* God.
3. Relationships and community. *Who are the people God calls me to care for?*
4. [[vocation]]. *In what way does God call me to steward my time and talents for my corner of the world?*
	 This covers service, as well as career: *What is my specialized work to glorify God?*
5. Compassion for self. *Do I steward the gifts I have to take care of my physical, mental, and emotional well-being? Do I love myself, whom God treasures?*
6. Budgeting. *How am I stewarding my treasure?*
	Time and attention must go towards the planning itself! After considering all ends, some love must go towards allocation to see if the means are being well-invested. *How are we going to strive for these valuable things? What is the plan to implement these actions?*
		Further, money is an included among time and attention as treasure. *Am I generous with my treasure? Am I sufficiently prudent to care for those under my care before extending beyond my means?*

Spoiler: he comes to love spending time with her (and from her children, their failures to love their mother without ego or ulterior motive), and he finds out she has loved him dearly all along.

[^2]: cf. Matt 6:21.
