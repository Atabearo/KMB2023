##### 🔖Write to remember something from today:
- Steph is working hard to improve herself and reconnect in her relationships. She recognized her attachment style to be avoidant-disorganized. It is disheartening for her to review her growing up and her behavior matching to that, but now she is working to change herself so others (like Noel) don't have to change to adjust to her, and suffer for it
	- Steph and I are overthinkers, but I forgot that I had identified as so. I should watch myself carefully too, so I can better control myself.
- I got to see Susan, and it was a big banter hang out in the pool. Honestly, I should do that more often! Like go hang out with Lily in the pool. Not to swim (haha), but because it was definitely a refreshing and lively environment for talking. We could have hung out in her apartment, but now this was special for both me and her.
