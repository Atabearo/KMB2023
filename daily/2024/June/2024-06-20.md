# 📝 Else on the mind:

"You didn't do anything, rather you didn't (do to Mahita) anything for her actions. You were neutral, but bc you were my best friend I expected you to be on my side" ===>
- I was on your side and I fought for you
	- I care about both my friends
	- "Choosing them over me", rather "I would choose both of you", but I'm going to do what I believe is right. And if you want something from me that I can't give, and you don't choose me, than *that's it*
- I don't think in black-and-white for anything
	- And I will learn as much as I can before I make a decision, and seek understanding.
	- If you're asking me to choose blind loyalty over what I think is right, 
		- I won't do that. I'm sticking by my principles
- I don't need blind loyalty, I'm looking for people who will work with me and who I can rely on to be there for me.

What Mahita did was different:
- she valued me as a whole more than she valued asking me for blind loyalty
- so I did break her trust, and she was angry and had to step back. But she could be good friends with me, because she did care about me, at least. We set boundaries. We communicated. And we've worked through enough to where I have her whole trust even if she doesn't have my blind loyalty. 
	- I will never support her wrongs, but I will always support her as a person. And she trusts my judgement.

- If I can't be on your side the way that you want me to, then yeah there's your barrier.
- If I can't rely on you to reasonably work with me and reach a mutual understanding, then I can't willingly put myself in a vulnerable position like that either.
