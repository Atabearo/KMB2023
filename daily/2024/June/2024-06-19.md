A meditation that creation is good and God has given us a law (that is good). "O Lord, my rock and redeemer".
#### Bible Journal:
God is good. God worked, rested, and loved.
The foundation of reality is goodness. 
Humanity is made good. Humanity is made in God's likeness. Man's original purpose was to Labor, Leisure, and Love.
I am good. My purpose is to be like God.
