##### ü™® Is there anything you need to get off your chest?
- Don't be depressed over nothing, dude.
	This is not even anything to "move on" from, and you don't have to be sorry if you did nothing wrong. Neutral emotion does not equal bad. AND he wants you to do well and write if that helps you get to the bar.
I want to write so I can move forward with my life. It is TIME to write my personal statement so I can turn this in. Ahead of me is working on things I need to (internship), fun (at the office). Mom gave me this week to focus. In 3 days my siblings will start to come down and it will be my mom's birthday. So now that we have had a solid 4 days of no writing, let's get to it.

The day after: 
- I don't even know what I was on about! But between the 10th and the last 3 days, we started calling on the phone. And we learn something new everyday, pinging through the day. 
- I know what he means now, I am just so glad he enjoys spending time with me, too, and talks to me at all. 
- Kind of interested in a general life plot, bc it's like wow how did we end up here
