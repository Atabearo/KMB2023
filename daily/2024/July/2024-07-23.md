### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:

- Spent lots of time in [[talking to a friend]]. Straight into the Gratitude Log.
- Tomorrow we hang with Emily. Today we might call Trisha.
- I think my heart might explode, the boy I like just called me gorgeous. Actually short-circuiting right now.
	I want to give him a really good hug and hold him for a while. My heart is racing and I feel a little light. 
---
- It took me a while to get over that.
- And then I also spent a couple of unproductive hours on the phone...
- Sorry I couldn't call back everyone.
- I broke my calves.
- And I didn't call Trisha, but I did text her back.

Things that sound good:
- peach candle
- beef stew
- chili's mozzarella sticks
#### Am I satisfied with today's decisions? What would I have done differently?
