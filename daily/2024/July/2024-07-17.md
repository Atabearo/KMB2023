### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:
I have been progressively waking up later and later since I started the Nuzlocke-- makes sense. But today I slept at 1am and woke at 11am, moving around at noon. It bad!!!!!

Also stopped writing after the Nuzlocke started last week. So, implementing this into a routine...?
