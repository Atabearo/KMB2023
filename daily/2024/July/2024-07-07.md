### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:

Today was a good day.

Recently, I have been starting and/or ending my days texting [[Ethan]]. A few days ago, he texted me about a very suspicious anime context and scene (that ended wholesome). He knew it would catch me off guard and garner an emotional response. It's funny to me and it technically does mean he's thinking about me and my mental tendencies, though it makes me wonder about our age difference. I wonder if he perceives the age difference like I do, because it's little mind pokes like this that makes him seem older than I am. Yet in my perception, he also very much acts like a 20 y/o boy. Both are true. I am increasingly fond of him it seems, we made plans to hang out at his house after his finals were up. 
	Today he helped me sort out my thoughts of my most recent QoL problem, in that I am not enjoying my life very much or stewarding my time. He is a empathy --> problem-solving kind of person, so he suggested Nuzlocke and hang out after finals, or to get out of the mental rut by asking someone for help. 
	I did thank him, though he was showing to be very happy to help esp since I do this for him often. I am here and I support him (always), and he knows that. He checked the weather for me. He sent the last message with a red heart, and I sent a hug back.

It was the journey back to Houston. Not many people knew I was here at all, though I invited [[Mahita]] for dumplings. It was the last time we may both be in Waco again for a while, as our college days are ending. She's going to go to Austin, I'm going to be in Houston, and so we scatter across Texas!

>>>

[[Diamond]] packing time was a very hot one with labor, but it was nice to eat pho with her family, have a little yapping time, and then after more labor a tres leches coffee break. I told her about my enjoyment problem and how awesome it was to watch How I Met Your Mother (she is actually such a good friend to talk to, I cry).

>>>

I get a little stressed out about my emotional state with Luis. 
	I get concerned that we aren't meant to be friends, being the people that we are. He did say that he hopes it wouldn't happen again where he would have to cut me off for that reason.
He called me at just the right time though, as I was leaving Mass and almost crying. We talked about things that we were thinking about like meditation and our relationship with social media and it was all calm again in me.
