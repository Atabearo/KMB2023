### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:

So tired today....

What happened? It was all up and good until lunch maybe. Diamond's mom cooked and we all ate together which was really nice. Got to chat with Ethan Duong for a bit (which was also stressful, but still nice). I was texting Steph while that was happening. Maybe I thought too much today, was very self conscious around Sammy. Why? I think I want her to like me, and that's the problem. I think she would like it more if I was firm in my decisions, haha. After we went out for stuffing and tea, we got home to air conditioning!

I had a thought earlier today after my A/C nap that I was having fun. It's fun to watch spoof movies with Ethan and buy yarn at Joanns. I don't know now though, I think I am just tired. Eating dinner with strange silence, the hour from 8-9 in worry, and then the actual hour we spent trying to do Nuzlocke, it was all a little much maybe.

Hopefully I can sleep now and feel better tomorrow. There's a lot to do, after all.
