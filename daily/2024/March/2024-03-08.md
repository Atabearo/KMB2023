A little bit too boy obsessed, and daydreaming. Thinking about how my class is going to graduate. Feeling empty on my own? 

Am I feeling incomplete? Not validated? I want to be comfortable alone and find out what I enjoy in life as my own unit. 

Or just step back and enjoy things as they are. If I like him, I should try to spend some time with him and hang out, do fun things. And the pressure won't be so bad.

Day dreaming is OK sometimes but I don't think anyone is worth that much of my time and energy, especially at this point. I got to focus on things that are around me at this point.

It looks as if I have nothing better to do than "                     ". But I am mismanaging! I do have things to do, I promise. I gotta do things for me.
