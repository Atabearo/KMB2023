"Nothing seems to faze you!"
"I guess that's because I learned how to let things go"

Enthusiasm. I want to do well. I want to hit the target everytime.
High pressure. Don't make a mistake. Don't mess up. "I want to score." "I *have* to score."
I could have... I hate my brain. They're the one making these mistakes.
(The thing that is so fun isn't fun anymore. I have to do it. If you missed, well you better follow up!)
(You know you're just going to fail. Why can't you do something so simple?)
(There's no way out. It's the end of the world.)
"OK, you can quit. Not like you'll die if you leave."
I don't have to be an ideal, and the guilt over making mistakes went, too. All of my shackles have fallen away.

> I know how this goes all to well. "I want to score," you tell yourself. "I *have* to score." And every time you mess up, a little more of your enthusiasm turns to panic, tripping you up and making you fail again.

> Desires like that are nothing but shackles. If you can't cut them loose, they'll drag you down.

Last year, right before I ran away...
I was terrified of games. Every time I got blocked, every time I messed up... I'd think to myself, "I have to be the worst volleyball player on the planet. I suck." I mean it. Every single time. It was kind of like clockwork.
I know wallowing in depression and spending time thinking about how bad I suck is all meaningless. But it's hard y'know? Even knowing better, my brain still wants to take it in that direction.

"What can I hope to accomplish?"
(Make every moment count. Change the mood.)
For the moment, I think what I'll do is go out there and score one point.
