#### What are you grateful for today?

7/23: 
- [[talking to a friend]]: Luis, Steph, Via on hours long calls. 
- The [[Soullocke]]. I am grateful to Soullocke today with Ethan and Zak. This is what it might mean to Ethan when he says that having regular things like this makes him feel less alone (fulfilling potential for [[long-lasting, genuine relationships (7-30)]]).
- [[Diamond's mom]]'s hospitality. I have not imagined what it would have been like to be without her support, but I am incredibly grateful to her. If there is any reason I should step up and apply Houston, this is a good one.
