#### Oratio

Good morning friend, 
	Where shall I seek you today? I hope and pray to receive your Word as you intend today. Speak through my being and let me hear you. 
	The parable today bring the image of soil. What are the weeds choking out your presence? What work shall I do to till the soil? I believe this is a good habit. It may start with *awareness* of what I intake. 
	
>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you
>For to all whom I send you you shall go, and whatever I command you you shall speak

You say that you both know me and that you have a mission for me. Every moment of the day I'm called to walk with you. I belong to your family, no?

>I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth

This guy, Lord, I hear that he relies on you and offers up lack of ability to you, leaning on you in his weakness. I want to do the same, in that I find you when I am in my day. How shall we do this, Lord?
	I'm quite clumsy and short-sighted. I do not know what I am doing or where I am going. I am distracted regularly, and I am very, very weak. All the same, I know you have a plan for me. You are a loving and righteous Father, so please keep with me. Help to remember you. I pray for the fervor of a lover to you.
*What does that look like?*
	I want to get to know you better. How can I relate to you? I want to be with you, talk to you, spend time with you. I want to share my day. I appreciate you, so much.

> My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day

I got a bit stumped on what this means--from the creation to the crucifixion, all that you do is a righteous act. For how you act in the world today? You sustain creation of course, and you guide our day-to-day life. I am grateful for that. For the good things I see, it is your hands. 

#### Act
In order to become more aware of God's presence in my day, I shall do a daily Examen. There I can find God's presence in my day, offer anything I haven't already, and find ways to do better the next day. By doing so, I shall
- Walk with God
- Act in ways in accordance with belonging to Him
- Gain *awareness*, see God acting in my world
