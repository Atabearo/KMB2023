###  📅 Daily Questions 
*Pick 3 to sample!*

##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- Tiff: I called her today, which happened to coincide with her hour long break from studying for her 3 exams later today. We have excellent taste in humor but also she is just a goofball. Ass-ence.
- I also got to walk to Keerthi today for Christmas on Fifth. She joined me, Aaku, and Jaimala to go around. I think if we would have been friends in undergrad if I met her then. 
- I had a couple of migraines today and been getting over flu symptoms -- I thought about phoning a friend to pick up medicine bc that last 20 minutes of Fabled was searing my brain.
- And Trisha!! She is the reason I can be awake at the hours I want to be.
##### 🤾‍♀️ What is on [[the grind]] today?
 - [ ]  Research tasks!!
 - [ ] Internship garner to ask for recc letters!!
 - [ ] Epi
### I can't expect to be this energetic for too long, so once 2am hits I get to work

##### 🪨 How are my thoughts? Are they serving me or holding me back?
- I had some thoughts for the past 15 minutes. I think it would have been a good deal to spend Christmas in Waco if he was also here. I won't pursue, no I won't, but I will think about how absolutely moonstruck I am with this guy. We have our differences and a bit suspect on how we interact (how do I tap into my own power to change our dynamic?), but I think we are pretty compatible. And we have a lot in common.
- For my own sake, it's a fact that he definitely asked all his friends about what they are doing for Christmas break.
- I wanna see his haircut
- And also give him a hug :')
- I can't believe he texted me as much as he did the day before he flew out
- I guess I'll ask to study sunday
- (No one will want to hang out with a bum with her head in the clouds, get to work stinky)
- Why am I preoccupied in this way? (besides being sleepy)
	- In my mind, a very important person
	- An opportunity to be with him is like an opportunity to enhance my present

# 📝 Else on the mind:
Things I want to do to feel better:
- [[2023-12-03]] Phone further away from me >>> And now my alarms don't wake me up! They do go off though, and even when I have them next to my ear they don't wake me up. Perhaps the solution is better sleep hygiene in general
- [[2023-12-03]] No social media from phone for month of December, except to post song >>> I ended up deleting TikTok, IG, and Snap, but redownloaded Snap to gather memories for post. I used it once to snap Isabel a food pic, but I backed off using it a few more times due to this commitment🫂🤗
