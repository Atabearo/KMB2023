Opening questions:
    Who do you care about? Who do you like to hang out with?
I care about my friends and family quite a bit. My more companionate friends always surprise me because that is *reciprocity* and *connection* in the moment, which is something I appreciate. I am not always in the moment as a person, but very appreciative of the people I love, nonetheless.
    What matters to you?
I have big ambitions in life because I want to better myself, better the lives of those immediate to me, and of people in general. I want people to be well and to be conscious. I want people to live.
    What gets you fired up?
In a list: creativity, poetry, food, new opportunities, sharing good things, hearing good stories
    What inspires you? What infuriates you?
    What makes you sad? Happy? Angry? Scared?
I think the saddest I have ever been is when my best friend suddenly was not my best friend, and he didn't care enough to work that through with me. As someone who doesn't have the option not to care, it sucked that he doesn't care about me in the same way I did for him (somewhat unconditionally). It makes me sad still that he doesn't know my true feelings on that matter, and because of this that I will not be the same. It is not *reciprocal*.
    What do you enjoy? What “floats your boat”?
    When do you feel grateful or appreciative? For what?
I feel appreciative for my friends, all the time. And the opportunities I do have. All the time.
    When do you feel you’re living life your way? Doing what?
I feel like I'm living life my way when I am taking interpersonal opportunities and bringing people together.
