To me, God is, as I connect to him, someone who is always in my corner and supporting me. He sees beyond my short-sightedness and with him, I am sure everything will be okay.

#### God, as far as his character goes:
God is good. God is all that is good and is woven into all that IS; the absence of God is sin and death.
God is love. This is God's innate character. The Father best reveals this to us in the ultimate sacrifice of His Son ([[the nature of love is sacrifice]]).

---

In relation to man, He is:
- A creator. In the creation stories, it is revealed that He committed to the acts of [[Labor, Leisure, and Love]].
- A father to all, in which we carry his image ([[image of God]]).

In prayers:
- "my rock and redeemer" (Ps 19): the foundation for reality and purpose (law), the one who redeems us from our brokeness.
