It is a good thing to have moments to [[reevaluate my beliefs and principles]]. My worldview interacts with Catholic learning and practice dynamically, leading to [[Jaime's expression of faith]]. 

- covert Catholicism (actions speak louder than words)
- listening is important
- all beliefs have a seed of truth to them, and diversity of belief and practice is valuable
- Compassion is central; the person comes first. Relationship-centered
- Relating to God is like relating to family/friend
- It is possible, perhaps even likely, that all are saved as an act of mercy and intercession as family
