> Are you giving God the choice parts, the firstlings, or are you giving God just vegetables?

We offer [[God]] our best because it is right and just, for Him who loved us first. He reveals to us that [[the nature of love is sacrifice]].

One way this can appear in my life is in giving God the first moment of my day, or at least a meaningful part of my day in the same way I block out time for other priorities. By making time for God and giving that time to develop our relationship, I can love God.
