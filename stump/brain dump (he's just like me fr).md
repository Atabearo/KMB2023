I am so whelmed with emotion, and I don't know when it's going to end
I forgot how much faith makes up who I am, my personal interests, and my worldview. I don't think I can be 100% me without it. And the prospect of having someone to share all of this with, not just the understanding that the whole of Christianity is about love but that he is also open to going to Mass with me, I am just so thrown. 

((turn))

I am not gonna be weird about getting to know him. I thought about telling Angel how all this is because I know she KNOWS a lot about Catholic background, and I think I will. I won't frame it like a crush (because I think it's more than that) or "God sent him to me" (which is true, but I don't feel like making a huge deal of it to others), but like a, I went to Mass with Ethan and I found out we have a lot of the same values and understanding about God, and love, and what's important in life.

*sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*

((turn))

It has been 3 hours since 9am and I left the house. God, please help me through this day.
