Nothing challenges my foundational beliefs like a good value clash.

I decided to go to the Saturday evening Mass so I could spend the Sunday with my friends in Dallas. I invited Angel to both. She chose not to go to Mass with me, but did go with me and the girls to Dallas today. Back-to-back texts to confirm her commitment.
It was an uncomfortable feeling to receive those texts. Both were important to me, but going to Mass didn't hold the same value for Angel. I wasn't upset with her, though. I had to contend with the reasons I was here at all.

I reconnected with my beloved friend that day. I wrote him a letter, and I felt out a familiar sequence of emotions: being understood, fear, grateful, small, and attentive. Wonder. 

I remembered that three or four years ago I wanted to be a saint, and that sentiment occurred to me as a perfectly possible thing to do. That is what I felt today. Something only I could provide to the world: to be myself and to be that well. Could the connections I make in my time, the age of the Internet and vast resources, be a flame that carries the Church into the future? My learning and past: would it be the BIC and Interfaith America that leads me to bridge Catholics to a compassionate worldview towards others? Was my journaling and learning on Obsidian a way to be close to God? Saints kept journals as part of their spiritual practice. Could my interconnected web of personal experience and insights be a brick in the Kingdom of God?

These are ambitious thoughts, but it takes courage to change.
