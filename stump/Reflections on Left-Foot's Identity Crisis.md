### Poverty Meets the Wealth Gap:
Left-Foot characterizes poverty both by the 'working poor' and associated hustle culture and as "those who never work". Even the wealthy are poor. All are poor when the focus is in on getting more and our selves are absorbed in ourselves and the things we can get for ourselves.

>Opening eyes and never seeing

"True wealth is in humanity"!, she screams back. "Humanity is about living and giving more than we could ever possibly get". Existing. Rest. Simply being. How could we forget?

How could I forget? My inheritance is humanity, my brothers and sisters are all around and mine by birthright. Rejecting it is to Other. We create and produce and we love products, but are they not reflections of ourselves in the end? And those that are so far removed from our humanity: are they not made by unwilling hands? To support real people, you have to go out of your way.

Live and give and love harder and live in the moment and be and give your time and focus invest in humanity and labor and love and labor for all of us
