> “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution….”
 *Constitution Preamble*

### Public health perspective
- intent for government to protect community health and safety 
- Why have government if not to provide means of communal support and security?
	- Community as a whole has a stake in collective goods (safe place to live, clean air, surface water, uncontaminated food, safe roads, [[disease prevention]]; role of [[public health law]])

### U.S. government structure in relation to public health
- Separation of powers is not a model of efficiency. The value in design is restraint in policymaking.
- Power is limited to protect individual rights and freedoms (individual liberty, autonomy, privacy, economic freedom)
