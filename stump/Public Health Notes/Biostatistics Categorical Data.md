Binomial: "Yes-No"
- proportion, probability of success

### Two-sample binomial proportion (successes/faliure)
- Normal-Theory method
- H0: p1 = p2

#### Contingency-Table Method (proportion)
- 2x2 table form of two-sample binomial proportion 
- THE way to go about it from now on
##### Test of independence
###### Expected Values Table (p. 380)
- Make the table (excel tip)

- H0 = these tables are similar enough, can assume independence (if TS is small, then we do not reject independence)
- Ha = these tables are different enough, cannot assume independence (if TS is large, we reject independence)
	- **If we reject independence**, we must use the *non-parametric test*
- Uses *Yates' continuity correction*
###  2-sample dependent proportions
N/A

### *Non-parametric* (small sample) of 2-prop independence test
- If the expected count for any value in table < 5, F-test will be used
- H0 = these tables are similar enough, proportions are the same
- Ha = these tables are different enough, proportions are different

Using '$' to pull out a certain value by name



### Goodness-of-Fit Test (1 variable, 2+ groups)
- Does the data align as I predict it will?
- The groups ARE different

- Upper and lower bounds of each group (in example, in cuts of 10)
-
