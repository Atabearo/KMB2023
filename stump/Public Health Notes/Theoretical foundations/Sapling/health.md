Health, in contemporary terms, is a *dynamic equilibrium* between the physical, mental, spiritual, economical, and social dimensions of well-being that one is able to achieve desirable goals and be operationalized by the individual and communities.

Defined by the WHO, it is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not defined by an absence of disease.

##### Determinants of health 
Health is is popularly described as 20% modifiable by clinical care and 80% is covered by [[social determinants of health]]-- physical environment, socioeconomic factors, and health [[behavior]].
	*Therefore*, medical care alone is insufficient to ensure better health outcomes.
