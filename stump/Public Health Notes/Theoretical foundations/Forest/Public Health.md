**Public health** is health care where the target is a group of people rather than the individual. It is the science and art of [[health promotion]] and [[disease prevention]]. Public health comes in the form of organized efforts in [[community health]] such as primary prevention programs, community-based care, and [[health education]] programs. They are *low-cost and simpler tech* compared to medicine, and *responsibility* is also with the community. 

There are [[Health Education Models]] and [[Public Health Theories]] informing public health initiatives. 

Here is a [[Brief History of Public Health]] figures.
