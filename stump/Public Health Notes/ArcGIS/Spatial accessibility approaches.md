Arranged by complexity:

- **[[Container]]**: # of facilities within a geographic area
- **Coverage**: No. facilities within a set distance from point  
- Distance to care ([[centroid method]])
	- Buffer 
	- **Minimum distance**: Distance between a point and closest facility  
	- **True distance**: Distance between a point and utilized facility ([[realized vs potential accessibility]]) 
- **Travel cost**: Average distance between a point and all facilities within a geographic area  
- **Kernel density**: Average facility density for each geographic area (improved container method)  
- **Gravity model**: Sum of providers divided by distance/travel time
