General
	Systematic approach in a way that is replicable 
		Debate (a part of critical thinking? Reasoning?) is important
		- Science is never settled nor decided by consensus (unlike government. It's not about meeting in the middle)
	Qualities
		Empirical (subjective interpretation on objective data)
			- Data informed
			- Not anecdotal
		Logical
			Unless counter-intuitive findings emerge
		Reductive
			Finding what does NOT work, what is left standing may be the answer
Types of Research
	Basic (Bench)
		- More internal validity, more control in the study (microbes vs people)
		- Lab setting
		- Low generalizability
	Applied
		- More likely in humans
		- More external validity, more internal validity (Less control, but more relevant!)
		- RCT/efficacy trial
	CBPR
		- Community setting
		- Findings shared widely in community before publication

In reality, all have to build off each other. It's all a large system when it comes to changing one factor (clinical CV disease -- diet, lipids, inflammation, AND physical environment AND social environment)
- Ecological framework ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© Soooo much easier to see with
