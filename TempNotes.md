## (Being) Good Company
- Good company is everything
	- Long-term relationship: would I fit into your life in the future? Are our lives aligned so? 
		- No quality but attraction to the value of a person can sustain a stable relationship. 
			- All other attractive qualities are wasted away with time.
			- Qualities are repeatable; not so the human person
		- Love maturing: love how the other person makes you feel ➡️ love who the person is (obvious?) 
#### Relating
##### Evidenced
- “Talking to strangers about you”, oh you talk about me?
##### Passive
- Start with being comfortable in your own skin
- Presence to express (interest or otherwise) comes after
- It’s not fair to assume the feelings of others; if you think that they feel negatively, let them know what you think and trust what they say afterwards
##### Active
Honest expression
- In word (Golden Hour dynamic)
	- You didn’t have to! / yeah, I know.
	- Are you really OK if I impose? / Yeah, but you better hurry up before I change my mind.
		- Same as “If I minded, I wouldn’t have offered.”
	- You don’t mind? / Oh, I do. But [the alternative]...
- In interaction
	- The exchange: do this silly little thing so I feel right about it, wouldn’t you?
		- Sharing a meal means that I freely give you something and lose something (love requires sacrifice
		- Solving the conundrum of a sharing a meal with a robot who cannot eat (PotWB), creating space for merciful action
- In action (body language)
	- passive foundation, showing interest through honest expression
		- To show romantic interest is to explore the possibility of that choice to love this person in that way
	- relating to sexual honesty: an expression of true love
		- True love = to love as God loves (I'm here for you fully, totally, faithfully, and fruitfully)
	- That's the nature of the sexual act, even if the person does not intend it
#### The meaning/beauty in belonging
-  There is external beauty, but the beauty I speak of is that is originates in the eye of the beholder
	- It is the beauty where the object itself is nothing special. It is all the more special because “it didn’t have to be” special or meaningful to me
	- It didn’t have to be this— my TWSBI pen for 30% off in Durango, Gansey’s Camaro, the Girl in Hyacinth Blue
		- Could have searched for better, but it’s mine
	- Didn’t have to be you, my friend, my child, my mother, my love
		- We didn’t have to be with each other. Not a need, but I like it. So we belong to each other, we fit together, claim each other, so we are special.
		- I urge you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment, who was once useless to you but is now useful to [both] you and me. I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. Perhaps this is why he was away from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a brother, beloved especially to me, but even more so to you, as a man and in the Lord. (Philemon 1:10-12, 15-16)
	- Power in commitment, a level of unconditional love in choosing and staying
	- I know what I like

## Spirituality

Reality
- His singular desire: that all may be with him and brought into His family
	- “God doesn’t ask primarily for perfection, but to live life with him.” TFP
	- 4 kinds of “all” to pray for: people of influence, people close to you, people difficult to pray for, people in your path
- All Love proceeds from God, God’s own spirit
	- Manifests in his creation, in whom His will is done whether we recognize it or not
	    - Ultimate and primary creds go to:
			- All praise, glory, and honor be
			- When we praise the children of God, we direct it to God
	- When we get praised, we ought to direct it to God
-  (JPII) Divine Mercy is the limit imposed by God on evil, the love of God in face of evil 
	- Redemption, merciful love, is stronger than all evil in the world
Virtue
- Humility
	- Humility is acknowledging and living the truth of what IS
	- I am (not) good at ____, and that’s all that means. [link to identity formation?]
- In practice: “Taking the last seat”
	- benefit of the doubt attitude
	- I don’t know anyone else’s heart. But based on what I know about me, I deserve the lowest spot
		- I am grateful for the lowest spot, I am just happy to be here!
- Can easily laugh at self [[how to fail]]
	- Not threatened, not performing, not pretending, not afraid of being something, not defensive
- Look at themselves, attachments, weaknesses, desires, and chuckle

- 2Cor12: Boast and rejoice at my weaknesses

- Merciful
Response

	- Know his character: Love, Mercy and Justice itself
	- Love what he loves, hate what he hates
	- See with the “eyes of faith”, to see the world and the people around us like he does
		- Ask to live like this, always
- What kind of attitude to take on the daily?
	- Why? Real wisdom isn’t just learning, it’s the heart’s disposition
	- Receptivity and trust
	- Gratitude
		- Humility [when we get praised]
	- Stewardship, love, consideration
		- Right response with gratitude
			- Driver: “I don’t want to let what you did for me go to waste"
		- Stewardship of material goods, and also the riches of the Gospel, a mini-mediator of God’s grace
			- Mediator of mercy, instrument of Christ on earth
	- Companionship. I’ll let you in on this…
		- There is an inner reality, within our heart and very being where we can find God dwelling, resting. This place is for us, too. For God and you alone. A contemplative attitude frequently returns inward to the heart, from the created reality to the uncreated presence.
- Action
	- Above all feeling or conviction or desire, to try. Willingness to love IS proof that you love
	- Compassion
- Consoling others
	- [kindness, merciful]
