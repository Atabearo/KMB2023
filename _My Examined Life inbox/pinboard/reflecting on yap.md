Trying on the tadhana costumes, I imagined what it would be like if it were Kadin or Ava Grace trying them on, and they are engaging people. They would be having fun and it would be obvious on their faces.
If it were Trisha, she too would be expressing whatever she thought of. I feel like she and Via would have interesting comments on the dresses.
Luis is also the engaging type. He would probably yap on whatever was on his mind.

It's not wrong that I am quiet. I was peaceful with myself in that moment. 

I think the difference is that Kadin sees engaging people as an opportunity, and he takes on that challenge. This is a guy who just went out and chatted up people at the Lighthouse. Luis doesn't just yap up everybody even, but he would call his friends and do so because he wants to talk to them.

Pros of yap:
- make genuine human connection

I can stop here and this is already incentive enough.

Other pros of yap:
- exchange of ideas and stories
- It can be fun. A happy time
- human expression
- good practice on how to articulate self for when there is a person you do want to yap to

Why am I not a yapper:
- previously anxiety stopped me from doing so
- I am more *comfortable* being in silence
- Energy burden sometimes exceeds desire
- "I don't feel the need to"

Why *I* should consider growing into a yapper:
- I attend bridgebuilding events BECAUSE I enjoy yapping. Those are incredibly fun
- I look up to yappers because of their ease of talking to others. It is an admirable skill to be social

Why *I* should consider growing into a yapper:
- Because that's how you have friends :o
