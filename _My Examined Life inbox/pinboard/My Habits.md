When I wake up in the morning, I will greet God.
After I pray, I will make my bed.

After I shower, I will wash my face.
After I wash my face, I will put on perfume.

After I wash my face, I will floss.
After I floss, I will make my task list for tomorrow.
After I make my task list, I will set my alarms.
After I set my alarms, I will answer my messages.
After I answer my messages, I will brush my teeth.
After I brush my teeth, I will submit votes of confidence.
After I submit votes of confidence, I will examine my day prayerfully.

##### Rewiring old habits:
When I crave a snack, I will drink water. (If I am hungry, I will stop and take a meal.)
When I want to go lie down in the day, I will pause all internal dialogue, count back from 5, and then do the thing.

When I feel uncomfortable in a social situation, I will ground myself.
After I ground myself, I will re-engage in the scene.

When I feel uncomfortable with a decision, I will ground myself.
When I ground myself, I will identify what I want to do.

When I am confused, I will ask questions.
