There are 3 components of the virtue of Christian humility:

1. To decrease my attention on gaining the approval and admiration of others
2. and my reluctance towards suffering deep emotional hurt from others,
3. and instead focus on giving of my heart to others.

Secure in my identity in God's love, I work not for distinguishment and am not afraid of what others can inflict upon me, but only for the good of others even at my own expense.
