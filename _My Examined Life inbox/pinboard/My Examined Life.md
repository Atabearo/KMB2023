### Author's Note: 
As I write this, I have my secondary apps on my list of impending things to do, along side my other incoming school tasks. I travel out of town tomorrow morning. I haven't packed yet. This is to express the potential importance of this activity; it may be worth investing time into, even now, in order to improve my quality of life and even finish my tasks in better time. The purpose of examining my life at all is that, under all my higher aspirations and desires for noble things, I wish to be happy. 
### What is this?
A working in-progress MOC of who I want to be and what that looks like. (Hi Celeste! Meet Gabrielle.) 
{To be constructed. I imagine it to be divided into different modes of engaging the world and then specifically, using my thoughts, experiences, and insights as evidence, a guide how to live my best life.}
### Why are you doing it?
I am prone to making the same mental traps over and over because I am hardwired for comfort, and my brain will in fact support a woman's wrongs. For a reason I cannot immediately explain, my brain also has learned to love putting me down. I know everything I need to change my life, what I am writing is to express my desire to change and the proofs why certain choices are consistent with who I want to be. The process: I decide who I want to be. Write what that looks like. Live that out. Become who I want to be.
### I am Jaime of the present, deciding to write in it now! What should I write about?
Because this is to write about how to live *today* and we want to spend most of our time living instead of theorycrafting, write about things that you have coming up that could be improved with this activity! And write about things that you are proud of yourself for doing. This is all reflection, but the way we want to live is **action-based** and in the present.
#### Other concerns?
- I think this is going to be dense AF the way it's panning in my head. How do we not get too bogged down in the details?
	Possibly focus on principles?
	Otherwise, it is good to have a record. Something >>>>> Nothing, and not trying 


# How to Live

## The Self
#### Thinking and Feeling
1. [[thinking more positively will turn dreaded situations into opportunity]]
2. Feeling intuition: [[do the things I want to do ‚û°Ô∏èü•Ø‚¨ÖÔ∏è do the things I don't want to do (but are valuable)]]
#### Decision-making
2. [[when you get stuck in a moment, do the next right thing]]
	- What can I do to be present for others? 
3. [[when you have something to say, say it. ‚û°Ô∏èü•Ø‚¨ÖÔ∏è when you don't, it's okay.]]
#### Evaluation
4. [[enjoy the process]]
## The Other
[[in conversation, keep it light]] / [[don't overshare]]

# Identity and Values
[[love is my mission]]
