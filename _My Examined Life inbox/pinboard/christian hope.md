> "Therefore do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but what is unseen sinc ehwat is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal"
> 2 Cor 4:16
