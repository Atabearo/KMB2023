Q: I have reservations about the weekend. I don't really know Brendan. I'm not close to the people in FSA.

A: It may be a good time to get to know him, then! If you don't know who he is, then who's to say you won't vibe? 

It's going to be a whole day with others. Just be present. Show others you want to be around them, tell people things you notice, ask your curiosities and contemplations that come to mind, it will be alright.

#### After Isang:
I ended up turning my situation around completely by riding with Castillo. And I may have found that I am much happier with my friends, though I do enjoy being at the event with those who I know.
