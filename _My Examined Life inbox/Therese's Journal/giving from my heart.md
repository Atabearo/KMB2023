Just doing it because I want to? Not out of fear, shame, or guilt, but out of my heart's desires to commit to action. I want to love others, confidence to give from my heart.

I want to start by trusting myself, with [[telling the truth]] to myself and following through with what I say.

Yet I cannot trust myself to act, trust my friends above my distorted perceptions, trust God that I will be OK. I have a great need for the virtue of [[Christian humility]].
