Model that breaks down how people perceive reality and process info.
##### Perceiving
Sensors/Feelers: experience first and perceive with senses. 
	(Analogous with Observant in M-B, who prefer observational facts than personal interpretation)
Thinkers: Step back and think through situations first.
	(Analogous with Intuitive in M-B, who rely on the past and future potential of what they see)

##### Processing
Watchers: reflect first, wait to make decisions (M-B: judging)
Doers: Act on new info immediately and reflect after (M-B: prospecting)
