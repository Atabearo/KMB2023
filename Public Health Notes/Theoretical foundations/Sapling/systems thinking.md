A unique [[Evaluation]] approach of problems within a wider, dynamic system. Systems thinking pursues the relationships and [[behavior]] among elements characterizing the entire systems. [[Public Health]] may study the [[health care system]]. Mapped with [[causal loop diagrams]].

General systems have these characteristics in common:
1. *self-organizing* and *nonlinear* means that the system and its interactions are **complex**.
2. To be *dynamic* and *tightly linked* means that studying components would be **ineffective in isolation**.
3. Cause and effect of complex systems is **unpredictable** because change can be *counterintuitive* and nonlinear (effects may be displaced).
4. Systems are ruled by individual components with **competing goals**, therefore *governed by feedback* and response may be *resistant to change*.
5. To be *history dependent* means that 

#### Types of systems
- Simple: few elements, stable relationships
- Complicated: many elements, unstable, *no adaptation*.
	Ex: a car
- Chaotic: many elements, dynamic, appear random.
	Ex: stock market
- **Complex adaptive systems**: many elements, metastable relationships, adapt as you go
	Ex: raising a child
