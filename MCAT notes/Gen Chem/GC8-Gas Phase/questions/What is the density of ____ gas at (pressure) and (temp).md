*unknown: volume. Need volume to calculate density.*

Approach1: P(g/mol)=RT
> R = 0.0821 (L)(atm)/(mol)(K)
> Everything will cancel except for g/L = density

Approach2: compare nonstandard conditions to standard conditions to find change in V.

> Use [[STP]] 
- *1 atm, 273K, 22.4L* are the value used
> PV/T = PV/T
