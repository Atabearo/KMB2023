The summit of the Catholic faith is the Eucharist: the participation in Jesus' Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, consumed by those who belong to the Church so that we may become more like Him.

This is the universal practice among the sacraments and other forms of worship (ex: [[prayer]], fasting, almsgiving, etc.). These universal acts find various form of self-expression. Prayer is the way in which we *remain in God* in our lives. The way saints have chosen to live their lives have branched out into different *spiritualities*--ways of living life. Because relationships have their own [[unique individuality]], different forms of prayer would more suitable to a person than another kind.

My spirituality is centered around [[offering it up]].
