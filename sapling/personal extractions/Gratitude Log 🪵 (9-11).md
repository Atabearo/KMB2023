#### What are you grateful for today? 
9/11:
- I should show my gratitude to Jae, it is her birthday today!
	I kicked myself in the butt to get outside and I was grateful I did -- I visited Jae and it was such a happy time to celebrate her.
- I ran into Teju on the way to the volleyball game, and she is just.... a very warm person. I recognized her too, without rehearsal! I think I just need to be in a calmer state.


7/30:
- [[Luis]] is a cool freaking dude, and I will just be glad we are friends. Today he lectured on the importance of sleep and flossing, and explained to me his plan to finance a bed. He is incredibly independent-- myself, I related a bit, but there is no one who can tell him that everything he achieves isn't his own. He is, as he says, came from the mud. I'm grateful to be friends with him. I hope I can still check in with him.
- I am grateful to make it to this desk today. I want to improve, and I think about this in the morning and before I sleep. I am establishing a good practice.
- I am grateful that I could have access to a library and gym, that I have a car to make it there. I am really grateful to be here in Copperbrook.

7/29: 
This past week, I've been grateful for...
- For the grace to let go of desires. Whenever I find that I can just give them up, and I remember to do so, I feel a lot lighter.
- Ethan taking initiative to hang out. I know now that it takes him a bit of effort to invite people out too, which makes me even more grateful that he does so. I feel anxious that I am giving him a bad time, but maybe next time I can remember that we both want to have a good time and show each other a good time, so all I could ask for himself and me is to be present. 
- [[Sammy]] for telling me to do what I want. I almost stayed home and cancelled our dinner plans for what would have been hours of waiting for Ethan to drop off Diamond's things. It was ridiculous in hindsight; he's not in a rush. I don't often identify my rush to bend over backwards into a circle at the drop of a hat, but I should use my head to tell myself that, like Sammy! "We will go out. Call him, now! Invite him over, he can join us for food and then hand off the stuff!" 
- I'm grateful to [[Trisha]]. She is also a stunning companion to have. As well, I got to call Mahita this week and catch up! 

7/23: 
- [[talking to a friend]]: Luis, Steph, Via on hours long calls. 
- The [[Soullocke]]. I am grateful to Soullocke today with Ethan and Zak. This is what it might mean to Ethan when he says that having regular things like this makes him feel less alone (fulfilling potential for [[genuine, long-lasting relationships (7-30)]]).
- [[Diamond's mom]]'s hospitality. I have not imagined what it would have been like to be without her support, but I am incredibly grateful to her. If there is any reason I should step up and apply Houston, this is a good one.
