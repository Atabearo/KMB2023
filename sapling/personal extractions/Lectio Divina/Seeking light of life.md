##### Meditatio
"I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
##### Oratio
Lord, may I take refuge in you? I have lived by my own ways and found them lacking and sad. Help me to find peace in you and follow you. Give me the joy of your presence, yet let me not forget to prepare. 
In a few days I'll be going on a Marian pilgrimage. Prepare our hearts for you always, and especially in this time of great celebration. 
##### Contemplatio
 "You are my hope."
 "With you, there is light."
##### Act
Set an alarm for the Lectio today, and seek God in your day. Be aware for today, especially.
