### 7/22: What shall I do with the desires competing for my soul's utmost desire?
##### Offer it up.
> Take Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding,
> all I have and possess. You have given everything to me 
> and to you Lord, I return it.
> Give me nothing more than your love and grace,
> for that is enough for me.

Earthly pleasures. "[[genuine, long-lasting relationships (7-30)]]". These are very good things, and it can fool me into thinking that this is the end-all, be-all desire of my heart. Is it a lack of vision that I can't see how all the goodness I find in others and in the world reflects back to a single, radiant point? 
	Lord, this is a difficult venture, but it is your rightful place to rule my heart. 

### 7/19: What can I do today to better understand or manage my desires right now?
##### Steward your time. Show yourself compassion by doing things for 'you' 5 minutes later, 5 years later.
As Steph says, 24 hours is a long time to reflect, find ways to heal, and do things for yourself. You can do a lot with your minutes. Consider them valuable when you work, when you rest, and know they are valuable even when you let them slip away.
	I, writing this, will not be here in 5 minutes and I will have to hand it off to the next Jaime in order to finish this thing we have been working on. I want to set her up to be in the best position yet, because only I can do this now.
