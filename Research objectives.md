Love letter to God (revealing his heart and mine), our story (my witness), what I would want people to know about God
### The basics
**Kerygma** 
- "Jesus loves us, died for us, is alive and near us" (core summary from Pope Francis, Evangelii Gaudium)
	- God loves you: "At every moment, you are infinitely loved"
	- Christ sacrificed himself completely in order to save you, he "continues to save and redeem us by the power of his total self-surrender. Look to his cross"
	- Christ is alive! "Alive, he can be present in your life at every moment" (Christus Vivit)

### Consoling the Heart of Jesus
**Jesus' Sacred Heart**
- Pure-hearted, simple man
	- "I Thirst"
	- His desire to bring ALL into the his Father's house
	- Allowing himself a burning desire for each of us, a heart that can be broken
- Jesus is a man of sorrows
	- "Behold this heart..."
	- Ps 68:21: "my heart had expected..."

**Our role**
- Friend of Christ, "be the one" to console Him
- How to console him?
	- Consoling the Head of Christ (through loving trust)
		- Giving him everything, our sins, weaknesses, attachments like kindling.
		- Living joyfully
	- Consoling the Body of Christ (loving others)
### Framing my thesis:
- "The greatest evil is the lack of love and charity, the terrible indifference towards one's neighbor... .[P]eople today are hungry for love, for understanding love which is much greater and which is the only answer to loneliness and great poverty" (Come be My Light, 83)
	- Repenting of hard hearts, the worst human condition apart from God
**Our role:**
- Connected to all mankind, and in especially the Body of Christ
- Incognito Christ: merciful actions of deed, word, and prayer
	- Merit and grace
	- Love brings others closer to Christ, even if they don't recognize His face
- Why incognito? Without loving trust in God's merciful love, weight of justice and shame, horror of knowing our true condition
	- Love softens hearts and prepares them for God
**The hour of death:**
- God judges by loving us, he does not condemn
- Soft hearts = greater one's capacity for love to flow through them, receiving and giving love = able to receive God in all his goodness, not be estranged from him
### The Church
Now that I have covered the mission, I want to bring attention to the big picture of salvation history to emphasize the heart of Christian worship:

**Salvation history overview**
- Covenants
- God's heart thru history
- Worship
	- Historical understood as sacrificial
	- Jesus' death

**Eucharist**
- How? Offering God the worship he asked for
- 3rd century Mass, celebration thru the ages
- John 6, the Bread of Life discourse
- Mass
	- Celebrating with others around the world...
	- in communion with God's saints
	- the Angels, holy holy holy
	- upon this offering of Jesus made present again through the Mass, united with our own little offerings, in communion with the entire Body of Christ-- does the whole world turn

**The Church**
- Upon this rock... line of succession
	- Priests foreshadowed
- Scripture and Tradition, Jesus gave us a Church
	- Jesus' desire for unity
	- Gates of hell will not prevail against it
- Jesus' gifts to us!
	- Sacraments and their biblical roots
### Consoling the Heart of Jesus, cont.

**Role of Mary**
- "Behold, your mother"
- Biblical roots, role of the queen mother
- Ark of the covenant. all the foreshadowing
**Her role: Mother of God**
- Consoles Christ best, spouse of the Holy Spirit, the Consoler
- Conferred a special role in making us like Christ (reference later section)
