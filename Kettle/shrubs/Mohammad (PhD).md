Met him at Kirk's pickleball game time. He learned how to use AI machine learning in 2 years, while he was learning English. Knows Farsi, interested in French too. His PhD and his passion ("can spend 13 hours a day in it!) is in mechanical engineering, specifically superalloys. He is finding out how to use machine learning to make superalloy blends that are specific and tailored to a mechanical product.

Offered resources for machine learning for me if I am interested.
