### Relationships
-  leaning in[[to be satisfied with God himself]], especially as Lent carries on (mid-Mar 2025)<<<<< back in the state of slight loneliness, but one I can lean into (Mar 2025) <<<<< secure in paring down my social interactions (mid-Nov) but I still would like to do more, qualitatively (end-Dec) <<<<<< content with less, w/ focus on other things (early-Nov) <<<< [[I have so much yearning (for company)]] (mid-Oct)

### With God
- I have been speaking more openly about God and having conversations about Him (Mar 2025) and at this point (after 6 months!) prayer is foundational in my day (mid-Mar 2025) <<<<< "focus on the other things" being G O D (late-Nov) <<<<< reconnecting with God (mid-Nov)

### In work
- slight fear of stagnation, trust the process (Mar 2025), trusting God (mid-Mar 2025) <<<< at peace with failures of work habits (end-Dec) <<<< Frustrated with current work habits, induced by failure (late-Nov)

### Overall development
- containing much more inner peace than before (Mar 2025) <<<< on the cusp of reclaiming joy?, assessing values (end-Dec) <<< Happy with the current momentum of my life ([[giving from my heart]]), I think of self-improvement and change (mid-Nov) <<<< I feel dissatisfied with myself, thoughts to change (early-Nov) <<<< [[My thoughts are so self-centered]] (mid-Oct)
