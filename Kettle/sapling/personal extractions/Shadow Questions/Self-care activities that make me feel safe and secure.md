## What are five self-care activities that make you feel safe and secure?

- Going out in nature
	All that is, is good ([[the foundation of reality is goodness]]). I find this goodness most readily available and visible in nature. Humans are fallen, our separation can blind us to God and lead us to mistreat ourselves, others, and the earth. When God is not apparent, his creation is always surrounding and beautiful. Nature is not judgmental. It is soothing, the notice of the stars of the sky, the movements of its wild inhabitants, or the vibrancy of a sunset makes you remember how big the world is. It has it's rhythms and patterns and a life of its own.   
- Praying to God
	[[God]] is the reality woven under my being and the perceivable world. As sure as that I will feel my own heart beat can I be with God in that moment. I profess that He is the most important person in my life. When I am with Him, I am safe and secure. His presence is big; to rest in it at any moment, he is a super haven. It is like clearing the fog from my eyes and a light to my heart. 
- Meditation
	Meditation is one of those practices that bring me to the present moment and clears my mind of any distractions. I am brought to a space of physical and mental peace with different forms of meditation. Often the shortest form of meditation available to me (being fully present in an action, such as a breath), I use to bring my attention to what I want to do, rather than what I feel like doing. Action by the breath, not by my mental inclinations.
- CBT journaling
	CBT is a long-established practice I use on and off to detect harmful thoughts about myself. I often get anxious and think unfair things about myself-- CBT brings me out of my own head. My habit of CBT journaling has transferred into a mental habit of evaluating my own actions and the actions of others with a degree of compassion and benefit of the doubt. 
- [[talking to a friend]]
	I think I feel the most relieved when someone I love and trust understands what I am going through and shows me their support. I have a lot of self-doubt sometimes, so hearing an affirmation from an outside source makes me more confident in my intuition or my actions. Often times too, my friends are happy to help me. I don't confide in others too often, so I think the opportunity to do so is usually one that is well received. Also, I have really good and thoughtful friends, so they can offer me a perspective that I may not have been able to achieve on my own! 

All of these are tools that I can use whenever I am down or in a bad mental space.
