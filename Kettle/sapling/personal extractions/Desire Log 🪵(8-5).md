### Heart faliure - (7/29/24)
I tell others I am content with this life and I am happy. But my happy circumstances cover my lack--I am dying today. I nearly failed to live, much less to my true [[Heart's Desires (8-5)]]. Aimless and adrift, without a goal even to enjoy the world and it's pleasures to any height--I sink into the ground.
	This is no way to live.

Following up on that [[change of heart]]-- I think that day is the exact opposite of what it would look like to follow after God's heart. I don't want to feel so *deadened to the world* that I ignore people who reach out to me and hide from people in real life. *I lost myself.*
And I've been losing myself for a while. I stop doing things, I go off and feel empty, and then I do a little thing to revive, but it never lasts long. It's a sad place to be. I'm not only stagnating but I am feeling worse as a being.
	How would I keep myself from falling off the edge again? What actions should I take to be better.
