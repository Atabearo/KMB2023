##### Oratio
Change my heart, Lord.
It appears to me that you are calling for me to examine my heart. I am recognizing my [[Heart's Desires (8-5)]] and my attention is drawn to your present heart. I want to receive your Word. I want to follow you, and to be with you. I don't know how-- or I am as stubborn as ever. But take me and form me little by little towards an image like yourself. 
What does it mean for me to go after your heart?
	I would think that it is a commitment to a life offered to you, which lies in intent? Why do I do the things I do. And it means focus--to give you to the time of day I would give to those I respect. I understand very few things in life, Lord. Keep me in your sights, and you in mine.

##### Contemplatio
- "Change my heart."
- "I can rest in you."
##### Act
Write a new morning offering to say, something personal and meaningful to me, a morning commit for myself. Spend a little time to craft it.
