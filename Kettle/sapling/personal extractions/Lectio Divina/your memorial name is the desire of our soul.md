Isaiah 26:7-19, Matthew 11:28-30

##### Oratio
[[Desire is at the heart of the human condition]]. We want and we crave. Desires are good, and they are useful; they indicate when we are deficient. When we are hungry, we desire food. Do we feed ourselves junk or nutritious foods? The daily decisions to satisfy desire, our behaviors, have a strong influence on who we are. So I ask myself, what do I stand to gain from looking into my heart and realizing my desires? If I want to become a better person, I must make choices that enrich my life. If I am aware of my desires, I can know them and make intentional decisions on how I feed them. By realizing my desires, I can choose to enrich my life.

What of desires I may have that cannot be satisfied on earth? C.S. Lewis suggests this as evidence that I would be made for another world. This desire for my true country, which can't be found until after death, should become the main object of my life so to press on to my desired destination. Today, the Bible speaks to me clearly: in our labor, we find no deliverance in the earth. Other lords of our hearts, earthly desires, are shade, yet God is that of light. It is substantial. It destroys all shade when it comes over the earth. On desire, Isaiah writes that God's "memorial name is the desire of our soul". He is the *desire* beyond earthly things, true and real Love above all the good things on earth.   Jesus extends this revelation on desire and offers a way in satisfying this desire. All who labor, "come to me!" he calls. "And I will give you rest". Come to me, take my yolk, and learn from me, and you will find rest for your souls. The end of all desires, the light that clears shadow is God. To satisfy this desire, I would not want for anything again. That is peace. Jesus shows us that we can find wholeness by walking with Him and sharing his mission.
