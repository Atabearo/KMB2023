##### Meditatio
- God is king, all is under his dominion
- Mountains may be secure in foundation but even they melt like wax before Him
- "This is my Son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased."
- "Listen to him."
- "be attentive to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."
##### Oratio

Lord, recently I have been overtaken with my whims and doing as I please, but I have been greatly unhappy doing so. Even doing the things I should is draining. I am working on disciplining my habits for your sake and mine. Please guide me and give me strength, as I cannot do good things on my own. 
It reassures me to hear today that you are the one who is overseeing the unfolding of the world and its narrative, and I trust you in the grand scheme. I think it would be awesome to trust you on my day to day, where you are present and when it counts. Be my light, and lead me today and always. I want to become someone with whom you are well pleased and favor. I want you to be proud of me and for us to be close.
##### Contemplatio

"This is my beloved."
"Listen to him."
"Trust him with the rest."
##### Act

Remember this intent throughout the day, to live with piety for your Father. At the very end, when you're reflecting, tell God what you have done with your time.
