There are some things that are possible and impossible for me and for any given person. 

As of now, I hold my past as a testament to everything I held back and was too scared to stand up for. I am inhibited because I am afraid of the revealing myself to others. I don't believe I am all that great, and I don't want others to see that I am quite incapable. This is an issue of confidence; I believe that quite many things that are possible for others are impossible for me.

So how to we build up our confidence? By doing things that *impossible*. I figure a great deal of things are out of my reach, so if I can do something that I can't do, wouldn't that mean I am wrong about my capabilities? What will my brain make of this behavior?

I have been doing a great deal of impossible things lately, and I am proud.

Some things:
- Going to an FSA event by myself
- Singing karaoke and just having fun
- Walking into the SLC gym to watch volleyball
- (9/22) Walked into Kaiji's bday, had a lot of fun!
	- Sang karaoke
	- Approached new people, introduced myself to people walking in (thanks Corona)
