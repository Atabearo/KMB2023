22: Ethan has been inviting me out to things.
	Just to hang and study, or to eat, we went to the FSA fam reveal together and after hung out with Josh and Jessica. He told me that they and he both agreed it was good to have me there. Today he told me that they were planning a game night next friday, and I think he laughed at me a little because of how excited I was.
21: Connor and I crocheted (and I got to practice my yap!).
20: God and I hung out on a bean bag in the meditation area.
20: Lily thinks we should hang out more.
	And I AGREE! She's been getting busy and I have been making myself busy.
11: I went to go see the VSA intramurals volleyball game and FSA Tadhana practice.
	And suddenly I was [[doing the impossible]].
11: Trisha sent me a return email with a <3 to say thank you.
11: I have a group chat, that I can text and it's a good time?!! 
	I haven't had that kind of experience in this new year, especially one that I feel comfortable enough to just sound off in. It's international snack hour in the sid and I can tell someone about it :)
10: I sent a 20 minute long voice memo about my anxiety and depresso
	It means a lot in that it makes me feel oogley-boogley arggggggh, tho all I can do now is own up to, YES I did want to share this with you so I DID! I've had 3 cries in the past couple weeks. I'm adjusting.
10: The front desk lady at the BUCC was enjoying yogurt like she's never eaten yogurt in her life and honestly that is how we should be living.

17: Steph, having brought one extra incense stick for the day, invites me to pray with her outside.
	This is an important spiritual practice for Steph, in her religion and how she lives.
18: I texted Steph how I started my renewal today. 
	I thank God for guiding her to where she is. May she keep following her conscious and doing as much good as she is able.
18: Ethan addressing me as bub gets me, every time.
	I felt a the smallest bit out of sorts sending him a wall of texts, but I made the effort and asked to call him! He has been busy as suspected, so we offered that we call tomorrow.
	9-10-24: I think we have been texting every day for ... 4 MONTHS. We missed ONE day in May.
