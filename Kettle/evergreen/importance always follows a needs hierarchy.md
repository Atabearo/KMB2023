Often I get my activities mixed up because I confuse importance with urgency. What is more important: an impending one-off birthday party for my best friend or writing my applications for medical school? In terms of hierarchy, my medical apps (*safety and security*) trumps the party (*social and belonging*), every time. 

While it feels like a mental challenge to "choose between the two", the medical apps are *always* more important. That being said, the ideal option is to choose both. If I had been working on the medical apps for an extended period, than taking a day/half-day to celebrate my bestie is definitely worth it. 
	If I haven't been working on my med apps, do I still go? The answer could still be YES; it may just be a wakeup call moment that from this point onward to work on important tasks.
	Making regular and good strides towards large/complex tasks ([[a healthy routine is a foundation for a life lived well]]) will make me feel more comfortable doing urgent/non-regular activities.
