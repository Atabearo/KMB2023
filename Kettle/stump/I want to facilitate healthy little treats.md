Scrolling IG 
	- Post: been noticing this weird thing where if I eat high protein foods in the middle of the day instead of pretzels and candy, I don't need a 90 minute nap every single afternoon like usual. Sadly we'll never know if there is a connection

- Desires
	- to take care of myself and the ones I love
	- to eat tasty things
	- to cook and share tasty treats
	- to provide source of regularity and joy to myself and ones I love
	- to develop my personality with evidence (such as this nurture aspect)

#### what it means

I was very proud of the champorado I made this morning. It felt a little healthier than ever before; I subbed in some chocolate powder for choco protein powder and sugar for semi-sweet chips.

It is important to me to care for myself/others, so this coincides with events and others,

(1) studying with friends on the regular,
(2) desires to cook, to randomly eat sweets,
(3) the desire to prove myself the person I want to be,

So it is a fun, intentional action.
