Bandura's SCT studies the factors behind behavior change. Like [[TRA&TRB- Theory of Reasoned Action & Behavior]], has a central focus on the rational aspect of behavior. Extra-individual concepts fall under the environment category of  **reciprocal determinism**: Cognitive factors, behavior factors, and environment factors influence another. These are our *target goals* for changing behavior.

##### Five basic rational capabilities
**Symbolizing**: we draw meaning from situations to process info (see [[learning]])
**Vicarious**: we learn from observation
**Self-regulatory**: we can internal standards
**Self-reflective**: we can reflect on personal experiences
**Forethought**: we can think before acting (as opposed to responding to immediate stimuli)
##### Building blocks of SCT
1. In SCT, [[self efficacy]] is the greatest predictor to behavior change
3. Knowledge
4. Perceived facilitators and impediments (compare to [[Health Belief Model]])
5. [[outcome expectations]]
6. Goal setting
