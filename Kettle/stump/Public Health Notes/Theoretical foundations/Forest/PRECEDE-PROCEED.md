- a multistep, comprehensive model for planning health interventions
- PROS: well-used, comprehensive
- CONS: expensive and takes a lot of time

*Planning*
1. Social Assessment ([[Needs Assessment]]): get to know community, leaders, key informants
	- AKA **[[asset mapping]]
	- Determine QoL with qual/quant methods
1. Epidemiological: prevalence and incidence data
2. Educational and Ecological assessment
	1. Determine relevant factors
		1. [[predisposing factors]]
		2. [[reinforcing factors]]
		3. [[enabling factors]]: factors that allow a behavior (ex. disability rails)
3. Administrative and policy assessment and intervention alignment
4. [[Implementation]] 
[[Evaluation]]
6. **Process** evaluation : fidelity, timing, how well did we do the content?
7. **Impact** evaluation : Did we reach the intended goals of the intervention?
8. **Outcome** evaluation : In the long term, did our intervention change health outcomes (Step 2 Epidemiological data) of the community?
