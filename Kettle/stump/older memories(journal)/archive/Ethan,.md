I am as always a big fan of communication and very much highly esteem you, so I wrote this in case I didn't take the chance to say it! Thank you...

You did help me overcome my anxiety in the end. For this past month, I haven't been getting hit with painfully strong or disordered waves of physical/mental symptoms anymore, in the same situations that used to trigger it. I'm more or less, present! All the time. Like, man I am so glad I won't have to deal with this in medical school, that's so hype.

I only wish that it didn't come at the expense of our relationship. I think letting my anxiety take center stage rewired my interactions with you in a way that lessened the having fun and warm and silly/goofy parts of our relationship, like the ones where we enjoy nice things and laugh really hard and generally constitute a good time.

I'm not stupid (or doubt where I stand with you or doubt myself), but I don't know yet how to overcome the rest of my communication barriers, or how long that would take. I wanted to leave an update. I trust that your door will be open and you will make time if I ask for it, as you have said.


(This is a part of focusing on my well-being)

I was confused when another close relationship I had lost, my friend starting acting one day like we were never distant. I asked why, and he said "the things I say, the things I do in any moment because I want to". I think you definitely feel that sentiment, like, it's not that deep. 

Though 

It is never certain how much time we have left though, so I will say that I am really happy to have given you a little levity and support for a time. willing

Despite my intentions and desires, I tend towards reservation and non-expression in any moment. And for stated tendencies, I get very reserved and uncertain how to act around you in general, which sucks absolute balls. I don't know how long and what it would take to overcome that.

### Why
I wanted to see him immediately to convince him not to hate me and that I still want to be friends with him, but I don't think words are needed in this scenario. 

I should focus on my well-being first and worry about being a good friend later. Just as he said, and that is what I should do.

So going forward, I think I will duck out of FSA/VSA for a while unless it comes up convenient, because that's too much for me right now. I'm going to fail.
