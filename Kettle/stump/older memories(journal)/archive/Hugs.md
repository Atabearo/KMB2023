I hugged him at a Ron & Ky event last year. He did greet me, but we didn't talk after that.
I had lost his regard by then--He had stopped caring. An emotional thing to be "annoyed and upset".
	2024 and I am the one with the broken trust. But we are friends in spite of that, so until the moment comes it isn't a talking point.

It was worse when we did get to a point of recognizing that the other person exists, so it was worse when my distrust showed.
	Getting asked where I was at Fiesta was stressful
	Meeting Lily and repeat meetings made me upset for a long time (we didn't talk)
	Seeing him go in for a dap and not having it in me to respond, that was a sad moment
We looked for him and he hugged his three friends and I felt ill
	I asked Lily to pick me up and he asked me where I was

I hugged him in November when we studied, and that was a happy moment
	He looked for a different place to sit
	Talked to Parker
	Lapped the BSB like, 3 times

Can you promise that you´ll at least use your words if you got beef with me?
	Not easier than shutting me out, and I'm sure it's not something you'll feel like doing either, but it would be more respectful to me

Remember when I was anxious?
	 I wasn't sure if you were someone who would stick around
	 And I'm still not sure! 😝 I believed you when you said you cared and that you would when we were close
		  That´s a lot of trust tho
			 It took me a while to trust that you wouldn´t hurt me though
			 I don´t think that you would hurt me on purpose now, but even now I have doubts you would definitely choose to keep caring if things went down again
	 But I know we are here now and I am happy to see you
