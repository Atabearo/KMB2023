### The vibe
Since my friends have graduated in waves, there is a growing gap in my life that used to be filled with interaction of people that I had a strong affinity with. I didn't realize the degree to which they shaped my happy college experience until I talked to Akhila, who now lives alone without all the people she was blessed with in undergrad. This is more on par with Lily and Maya's experience of undergraduate being "boring"... it didn't have the same spontaneity and "walking together" that filled my days. I don't think I want the Asian community vibe so much as I want to go to events with my friends, generally spend time with the people I love.
### What I can do about it

I started accepting invitations more than I inviting others because I got busy (and come think of it, those who didn't invite me as much, I didn't make the effort to see them). Now, more than ever, I have to *take the initiative*. Now, we are all busy and/or far away. The yearning goes away when I am with others. It would benefit me that I wouldn't have to be dependent on others to drag me out of my house.

October; how can I incorporate my loved ones more into my life?
- Find out when/where Lily studies and join her/her group -- after Germany!
- Plan to call 2 people per week (and leave the day open for "feeling like calling" particular people)
