I heard it recently said that to love truly unconditionally would be to "embrace it all", the sin, the sinner, their choices in total. I don't believe that to be fully loving.

There is [[no good sin]], and there is justice in opposing what is harmful to others.

But we are all sinners ([[know you are weak]]). There is nothing inherent to who we are that is totally our own--[[it's all cards]]; so, we should love another even with our propensity for falling. We do good to those who "don't deserve it"; that is our call to love, that is mercy.
