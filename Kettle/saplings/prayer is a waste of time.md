Prayer done with love is done with a spirit of *gratuitousness*, or done freely. Gratuitous prayer is borne out of a desire to spend time freely with God simply for the joy of being together. Framed in terms of productivity, it is not so you, effectively, can produce anything or gain anything out of it. Prayer is (so to speak) a waste of time ([[love is sacrifice]]). Paradoxically, the more prayer is done freely, the more it will bear fruit. Therese of Lisieux[^1] terms this phenomenon as "fruitful waste". 

Love is not primarily to do things for another person, but to be there with them ([[reciprocal dialogue of love]]). When Jesus called the Twelve, he chose them first of all to "be there with him"[^2] and then to share in his work (preach, cast out demons, etc.).

When we learn to be there for God alone, [[to be satisfied with God himself]], we learn by doing to be there for other people ([[prayer changes the one praying]]). Philippe claims that those with a long-established prayer life have a "noticeable quality of attention, presence, listening, and availability" compared to those whose whole lives are given over in activity[^3].
