God created the world good, therefore it is good in its foundation. 

When we are close to God, we have a freedom in our action to see reality as *it is* and live accordingly. All sin disfigures our ability to see clearly ([[no good sin]]) and disrupts our very being. Inner peace, a whole unity in our being, is our natural state. The purpose of prayer is to be with God ([[reciprocal dialogue of love]]), and when we approach [[the source, the root, the ocean]], we learn to be like Him. He purifies us in a fiery Love that burns away at impurities. We see as God does: his world, its creatures, the multitude of his family, his very Body. And it is very good.  

> We don't fast because the things in the world are bad; God created the world and called it good. But in fasting we realize that the things we give up are wants, not needs, and they fade away. Creation is good, but not ultimate.
