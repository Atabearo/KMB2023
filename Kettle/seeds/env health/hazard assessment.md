#### benchmarks
##### no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)
- objective of most toxicological studies is to demonstrate NOAEL from chronic studies, the *highest dose tested* in which NOAE was detected
- benchmark for finding ADI or reference dose (RdD) in the U.S. 
	- safety factor is level of uncertainty determined by nature and severity of effect
$$ \text { ADI }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kgBW}) \text { human }=\frac{\text { NOAEL }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} \text { animal })}{\text { Safety factor (usually } 100)}$$
##### acceptable daily intake (ADI)

##### maximal permissible intake (MPI) per day
