#### Principles of RM decisionmaking
- **Information Quality:** scientific info should be clear and transparent. 
	- Keystone of EB-decision making. IF we are to make policies based off of scientific opinion, the scientific process to get these should be available to stakeholders and allow for public participation.
- **Precaution**: better safe than sorry
	- lack of full scientific evidence of adverse effects should not be an excuse to put off implementing cost-effective protection measures.
		- See historical disputes on need for regulation of toxic substances (tobacco, asbestos, lead)
	- Regulating potentially hazards may be prudent even if all scientific issues are not fully resolved.
- **Priority Setting**: given insufficient resources to eliminate all risk, the most undesirable risks should be prioritized to achieve maximum risk reduction?
- **Exposure and RA**
	- Decisionmakers should be informed of a substance's exposure, risk, and its potential to be hazardous
- **Differentiation**
	- If same substance has different risks in different IRL applications, RM and regulatory process should discern low-risk/high-risk and low-benefit/high-benefit applications.
		- Ex: EPA attempted to ban all industrial asbestos use
- **Rational Alternatives**
	- Risk/costs/benefits substitutes to potential hazards should also be considered by decisionmakers
		- ensures innovation leads to net benefits & net reduction in risk rather than replacing old risks with new risks
- **Value of Information**
	- Value of new info from research should justify the costs
