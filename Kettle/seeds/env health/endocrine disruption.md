# 2024 EDC report and guide: plastics, pesticides, and "forever chemicals"
EDCs intefere with hormonal action
- convergence on cell lines, animal models, epidemiology == strong evidence linking ECs to detrimental health outcomes
	- linked to brain development and behavior, metaoblic problems, reproductive health, cancers, heart problems
- vulnerable population: prenatal development, early development, puberty
	- "the timing makes the poison"
- Bisphenols
	- BPAs and substitutes found in reusable food containers, can linings, thermal paper receipts, plastic water pipes, paints, adhesives, medical/sport equipment
- Phthalates
	- PVC products, personal care products, fillers in medication/dietary supplement, dos and beverage packaging, children's toys, medical tubing
- PFAs
	- Common water contaminants and found in multitude of products
- Pesticides
	- DDT
	- Glyphosate: most widely used herbicide worldwide
	- Chlorpyrifos: organophosphorus pesticide
EDC policy landscape
- Shift from fuel to plastics
	- more plastics produced, more EDCs 
- Highly hazardous chemicals are banned in the Global North, exported to the Global South
- Global problems and global policies
	- Everyone has right to same protections
- Policies
	- New Global Plastics Agreement: new treaty to prohibit use of toxic chemicals, cap production of plastics, no toxic recycling
	- New proposal in the EU to restrict all PFAS
		- Huge industry pushback
# Threatened Reproduction by Shanna Swan
1. **Problem**: Reproductive issues due to environmental [[exposure]]s. Decline in semen quality, small penis,  etc.
	- Swan's research: testicular descent, penile width, AGD, scrotal size
	- Count has been going down for sperm concentration, birth rates, miscarriage rates increased
2. **Causes**: *Chemical exposures* and lifestyle factors
	- EDCs
		- Phtalates, bisphenols, PFAs, flame retardants
		- Seen in home items
3. **Effects**
	- *Prenatal exposure:* Prenatal exposure happens in critical development, where the foundation is being built. If a father or mother smokes during pregnancy == 40% reduction in sperm count vs 20% reduction in sperm count if the child smokes during adulthood.
		- Poor reproductive health has lifetime effects (associated with higher mortality)
		- Passed to the reproductive cells of fetuses == 3 generations
4. **Solutions**
	- Remove chemicals that are hormonally active
		- Cause harm at low doses, persistent
	- Replace with rational substitutions shown to be safe prior to marketing
	- Regulate; risk assessment in untested chemicals
		- Only 250 of 60,000 existing chemicals have been evaluated from EPA
