RA predicts effects of a substance's effects to human health and the environment, based on combo of *[[exposure]]* and degree of *[[toxicity]]*. 2 categories:
- **human health RA**: process to estimate nature/probability of adverse health effects of in humans exposed to agents 
- **ecological RA**: process used to evaluate likelihood environment impact as result of exposure to stressors ()
#### Applications
- Evaluating use options (ex: groundwater or surface water use, etc)
- Setting acceptable levels (ex. MCLs, see [[hazard assessment]])
- Comparing two products (ex. comparative RA of pesticides)
- Developing mitigation measures

#### Human Health RA Process
1. **data evaluation:** studying the substance in the ENV media
	- risk based screening levels (SLs) combine exposure assumptions with EPA toxicity data to derive equations, SLs that are protective over the human life course
	- SLs can be used to assess condition of ENV media as related to human health
2. **[[exposure]] assessment**
	- All about [[exposure]]: routes, receptors, exposure pathways (see [[disease causation triad]])
	- Exposure quantified: exposure point concentrations, receptor exposure parameters (BW, duration, time, age), constituent specific parameters (ex: vapor pressure, dermal absorption factors)
3. **[[toxicity]] assessment**
	- Effects? Dose-response? Toxicity values?
4. **risk characterization**
- Cancer risks
	- *Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk* (ECLR): measure of excess probability of cancer over background level
	- EPA's acceptable risk range is 10e-4 to 10e-6
$$\text {ECLR = dose}*\text {CSF}$$
	- *Total ELCR* = sum of chemical specific ELCRs
- Non-cancer hazards
	- Hazard quotients (HQ)
$$\text {HQ}=\text {dose/RfD}$$
	- **Hazard index** (HI) = sum of all HQs

#### Ecological RA
1. **Problem Formulation**: goals to drive RA, often derived from a law
2. T**arget and analyze [[exposure]]**
	- *Prospective:* uses models to estimate chemical concentrations
	- *Retrospective:* uses existing scenarios, measured concentrations
3. **Define ENV effect thresholds**: study effects of chemicals/stressors
- purpose is to determine if and how much an effect is present
- **Risk characterization:** deterministic or probabilistic
