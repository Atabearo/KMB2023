The Hill criteria are aspects to consider in a relationship to consider to interpret causation. These are used for THE question: is there any other way of explaining the set of facts before us, or another answer more likely than cause & effect?

Dr. Brooks advises to use it as a critical thinking tool.
### What attributes to consider causation?

**Strength:** stronger associations more indicative of causal exposure.
- Bias less likely to explain observed association
*Consider also:*
- Bias or confounding factors can produce strong noncausal association
- Should not dismiss small association because of size

**Consistency:** Is it repeatedly observed in different circumstances? >>> more likely to be causal.
*Consider also:*
- Don't let lack or impossibility of repetition rule out the possibility of conclusions

**Specificity:** One cause leads to single disease, not multiple.
*Consider also:*
- Does not apply to non-infectious exposures (ex. lung cancer caused by smoking, arsenic, asbestos, etc)

**Temporality:** Exposure **must** precede disease occurence.

**Biological gradient (dose response)**: different doses are associated with different associations of outcome >>> if dose response observed, association is more likely to be causal. 
*Consider also:*
- "threshold effects", and nonlinear associations

**Plausibility & Coherence:** is it biologically plausible? (Common sense check:) It should not conflict with natural history & common knowledge of disease
*Consider also:*
- many epi studies identified causal relationships before biological mechanisms were identified (ex: carcinogens found in cigarette smoke discovered after initial epi studies linking smoking to cancer)

**Experiment:** Sometimes it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence
*Consider also:*
- often infeasible/unethical to conduct certain experimental studies
- observational data provides bulk of epi data for judging causality of associations

**Analogy:** Sometimes it’s OK to judge by analogy (ex: if certain drugs during pregnancy cause birth defects, easier to accept possibility that a new drug may also cause birth defects).
*Consider also:*
- absence of analogy reflects lack of imagination/experience of researcher, not falsity of hypothesis
