#### Considerations for use?
**Driving forces**: need to feed increasing world population
**Pressures on ENV**: pesticide use keeps pace without dramatic increases in devoted agricultural land (preserve the environment)
**State of ENV**:
**Exposures to hazards:** 
- pesticide residues at harvest/consumption (dietary)
	- long exposure duration, low volume
- occupational 
	- short exposure duration, high volume 
- contact with treated surfaces (bystander)
#### pesticides as an [[exposure]]
Risk is dependent on bioavailability of the compound and its toxicity to non-target organisms
$$
Risk\% = (Persistence)\times (Mobility)\times (Toxicity)\times (Volume) 
$$
#### Using pesticides responsibly?
Rachel Carson wasn’t against pesticides. She was against the indiscriminate use of pesticides. She was made out to be the villain, but she was quite pragmatic.

##### Examples:
- organophosphates, like sarin gas/Agent Orange
	- herbicide and human carcinogen
