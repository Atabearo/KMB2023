**Environmental health (EH)** is the *study of human health impacts* incurred from environmental *[[exposure]]* to various agents ([[disease causation triad]]). 

#### EHS expanded:
The WHO defines EH as the theory & practice of assessment ([[core functions of public health]]), addressing those exposures (or physical, chemical, biological, social, psychosocial *factors in the environment*) affecting present and future health.
- Functionally, achieved thru identifying and evaluating hazards and limiting exposures to hazards.

NACCHO definition emphasizes *health interrelationships* between people and environment ([[OneHealth]]), and the ultimate EH goal of fostering safe, health-promoting environments.
