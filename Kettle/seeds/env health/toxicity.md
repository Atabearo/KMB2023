is the capacity to produce an adverse effect. A function of [[exposure]]. 
- occurs at multiple levels
### Assessment Values
**Carcinogens**: cancer slope factors (CSF) used to calculate probability of a cancer effect associated with given dose
- For cancer risk, endpoint is *dose/response relationship*
**Noncarcinogens:** Reference Dose (RfD) is the daily exposure level protective of human health, even to sensitive individuals
- For non-cancer/hazards, thresholds for adverse effects, type and severity of effect

#### Pharmacokinetics: body does to substance
##### ADME
**Absorption**
- *Bioavailability*: fraction of total drug administered
	- Affected by route of exposure, solubility, first pass effect, drug formulation
	- Drug must cross membrane to be in the body
		- *what passes through PLB easily?* Lipophilic(high Kow)/nonpolar, small size, nonionized
		- Like dissolves like--stomach absorb WA and and intenstine absorbs WB
#### Toxicokinetics: what the substance does to body
- the study of the internal kinetics of all toxic substances
