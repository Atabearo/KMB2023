Just doing it because I want to? Not out of fear, shame, or guilt, but out of my heart's desires to commit to action. I want to love others, confidence to give from my heart freely. To act freely means to act according to the world as it is, [[a foundationally good reality]]. In this way I act not out from my emotions and passing desires but from a place of enduring love ([[the source, the root, the ocean]]).

I want to start by trusting myself, with telling the truth ([[death ends the deception]]) to myself and following through with what I say.

At the moment I cannot trust myself to act ([[know you are weak]]), to trust in my friends above my distorted perceptions, to trust in God that I will be OK ([[prayer is a waste of time]]). I have a great need for the virtue of [[christian humility]].
