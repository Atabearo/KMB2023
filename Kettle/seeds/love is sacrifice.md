The nature of love is sacrifice. This is revealed throughout salvation history. What greater love is there to lay down one's life for a friend? Not only to die for someone, but to live for another?

The first act of care after Adam and Eve committed the first break from God was when God clothed them in animal skins; let this be a lesson. There is loss in loving. Something had to die to provide for you. Even in the Father giving His Son for us, in the way that He descended among us to become fully man, the Father sacrificed something in their relationship in a way that will never be the same again. The Son in turn laid down His life for our sake.
