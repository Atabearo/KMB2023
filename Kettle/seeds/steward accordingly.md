> Are you giving God the choice parts, the firstlings, or are you giving God just vegetables?

> You shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from your land that the Lord your God gives you... then you shall say before the Lord your God, 'I have removed the sacred portion out of my house, and moreover I have given it to the Levite, the soujourner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me...'" (Deut 26:2, 13)

We offer [[God]] our best because it is right and just, for Him who loved us first and revealed to us that [[love is sacrifice]]. As such, in the resources that we are blessed with-- our time, talents, and treasure--it is right and just [[to be generous]] with what we have been given.

One way this can appear in my life is in giving God the first moment of my day, or at least a meaningful part of my day in the same way I block out time for other priorities. By making time for God and giving that time to develop our relationship, I can love God.
