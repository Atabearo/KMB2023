### Ideas I had:
- question crowdsourcing
	I think it would be pretty fun to crowdsource answers and ask people questions, make them think. 

### Who I want to be?
"Okay looks like waking up with intent. It means we have things to look forward to -- whether that is potential or realized. It means taking the power to know what I want and then just... do it. I get closer to knowing myself better (and BEING better) and we find out what we like. It is taking in the day constructively, even if it is challenging. It means being active and aware when it's time to be. It means having a clear mind, so that when the time comes to engage, we CAN DO IT! It means we are consistent and moderate in our emotions (no high and low swings)."
