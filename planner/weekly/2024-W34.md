### Thoughts to persist:

Am I missing vision? 
What does it take to make a good day:
- Intention
- Orientation towards intention
- Therefore, direction towards a meaning/person I want to be
- Do that everyday = profit

The weekly reflections:
- What I want to do (job, school, friends, etc. past the current day)
- How I am doing overall -- this week! Am I becoming?

--- 

The emphasis on TRUST for the future
