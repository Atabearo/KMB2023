# 📝 Else on the mind:

Words I heard today:
- Benjamin Franklin's advice to "avoid trifling conversation" and to "only speak when it benefits you or the other person" ==> better conversations?
- Our [[evaluations are not random]] but a result of asking and answering questions. This is likely telling towards my negative thought spirals and evaluations of a certain siuations

Personal
- Evaluating my situation... What questions could I be asking?
	- Do I trust this person?
	- If the worst-case scenario were to happen, would he leave again? Does that matter to me?
	- Do I have anything of value to offer to this person? 
	- Are these feelings I can communicate with this person? Does that matter to me?
	- Why do I value this person so much? Do I care about him or the way he makes me feel?
