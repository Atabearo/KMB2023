###  📅 Daily Questions 
*Pick 3 to sample!*

##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- Lily. I gave her tomato soup today. She kept going in for a hug, but I backed away because she is sick!
- Coming home and seeing Isabel. It's nice to have a roommate and do things together
##### 🤾‍♀️ What is on [[the grind]] today?
 - [ ]  Nothing left but Floreciendo!
##### 🪴What have I done well today?
- The group project for Lanning went well! I was proud of how I interacted with Jonathan and Mattie before class. I have grown quite a bit socially in the past 4 years--before I would not be able to be so comfortable.
##### 🧠 What have I learned about myself?
- (yesterday) my anxiety is a skill issue
##### 🪨 How are my thoughts? Are they serving me or holding me back?
- I liken my interactions with Luis to be like a presentation: nerve-wracking and hard to communicate! I am past denial (Jan-Mar), anger (April), bargaining (April-May), depression (June-October), and made a genuine attempt in the acceptance (November). Whether it's right person/wrong time or just plain mismatch it is an endeavor for me to interact with this man. So I think I got to let go for my sanity-- or at least, let go of hope that we will be friends for long.
