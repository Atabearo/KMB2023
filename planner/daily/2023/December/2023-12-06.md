##### ⌛What would I do differently today...

##### 🪨 How are my thoughts? Are they serving me or holding me back?
- I saw Luis today. I think the attraction goes away easier when he is also distracted, so it's good to know that we are acquainted/friends in a capacity. If it is to be that we outgrow each other, that is OK! Fact of life.
