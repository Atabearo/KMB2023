###  📅 Daily Questions 

##### 💛 What good shall I do today?
- Say bye to my family graciously
##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- My brother and sister and mother and father. Love them a whole bunch. 
- Since we all think each other is cool, having siblings is like having childhood friends. It's like a friend group you can count on, we made an igloo and we all hang out on the couch together. So comfy.
##### 🤾‍♀️ What is on [[the grind]] today?
 - [x] START Ylitalo work

##### 🧱The grind contributes to:

##### 🪨 Is there anything you need to get off your chest?
- I think I am definitely in love, right
	- I'm scared
- What am I gonna do about it? Treat it as a non-urgent matter
	- Don't worry about "missing out" or not getting to taking as many opportunities "as you wanted to" because **you, my friend**, ***have things to do. Respectfully.*** The pay-off is SO BAD if you're not hanging out AND not doing your work.
- Rules
	- If we are taking more than 5 minutes to do something, we change tasks
	- We are not going to spend dedicated time pondering over this
	- He likes hanging out with you for sure. I know you want to say something about what happened last year, but we are going to remember it as context.
