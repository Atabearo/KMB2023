###  📅 Daily Questions 

##### 💛 What good shall I do today?
- The good I shall do the rest of the day is to go to sleep and keep on going. When I wake up tomorrow, I want to live. I want to breathe the air, and see the sun, and feel the ground on my feet.
##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- Jess. She made me feel welcome
	- Asking other people: when was the last time we connected? 
	- Tell me what's been up with you since then. 
	- Show care
	- She has a cat, into health and eating and how it makes her feel, prioritizing herself at last (exercise, food, time). School is OK (not a talking point)
- Lily. Trustworthy friend indeed
- The workings of Trisha and I's friendship.
- Diamond for buying me wine and texting me. Isn't it awesome that after all the sacrifices of social time that we are still here?
- Epi cohort. Today was a good day with them and Dr. Benavidez
- Isabel and my living situation. We have tinola today. Cooking acc when???

##### 🪨 Is there anything you need to get off your chest?
- I feel like there is a lot of components happening right now, which is why I'm writing things down.

		- Luis: the plan is that we left positive impressions on each other, and we can hold for a bit. He can be him and I can be me, and when it's time to reconnect we will.
