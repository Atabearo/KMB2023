###  📅 Daily Questions 

##### 💛 What good shall I do today?
- I shall organize myself today so that I can be fully ready to take on tomorrow
##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- All this that I have, my family, this house, this quiet space, even having Jet lying here...
- People I could call my "soulmates". That is, people who I connect with and have an understanding with on a inextricable way
- Ethan, in particular. Over the past week we have been sharing our busy trips through pictures and reply chains. I told him "I love you", and he said it back; we both love talking to each other as we revealed. This Friday we chatted in airports and before sleeping, and yesterday we FaceTimed and talked until it was late. He has been particularly affectionate in the last few days. Not not cute, perfect, very funny. *Hermoso*, adorbs, goofy. Lots of love. Bubs. It goes both ways, I guess.
	- He's been sending me pokemon updates and food pics for a while! Took them for me
	- I got to share the brain fart that "he's really passionate about stopping children from developing!"
	- He shared his pet/baby name list through collab format

##### 🧱The grind contributes to:
- Resting fully before the time comes to do big girl things... like writing apps and prepping for internships
##### 💭 What are the words do you need to hear?
- God is by my side.
- You are capable of good things.
- "Do the scary thing first and get scared later" (Lemony Snicket)
- Push through and keep pushing, and then you will have all of this summer AND all of next year to have your fun
##### ⌛What do you want to take with you into the future?
- 
##### 🪨 Is there anything you need to get off your chest?
- I spend a lot of time going over things that already happened (not in a processing way, but in a inefficient just-for-fun kind of way)
	If you crave interaction, instead of looking into the past, look into the present! (Or write it here, so at least it's out of your head)
- I'm not afraid of interacting with others, but for some reason I hesitate sometimes. Like before calling, or texting back later when I could sooner.
	- It takes time. Just remember that your brain is also stacking odds against you so it is never as bad as it seems it will be.
	- Breathing is a gamble. If you're going to fail, fail with your whole heart! (meaning, don't let worry be a suffering and let suffering kill your motivation to try)
