	- Reflect regularly
	- Read, learn, go to the library
	- Do things I enjoy (crochet, see my friends)
	- Do things I wanted to (watch show Trisha recommends)
##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- a friend like Luis, because he does what a good friend does, and he does want to engage with me... I just am in some sort of vegetative state atm, but I know I would be able to call him back and it would be like normal.

##### 🪨 Is there anything you need to get off your chest?
- I think I'm on a dopamine detox of some sort, where the dopamine is just the seeing people everyday at college. I spent a lot of time in the last 3 days reading old messages and lying, unable to do anything. I sleep early because I want the day to end.
##### 🏃‍♂️Rundown:
*how's it going?*
