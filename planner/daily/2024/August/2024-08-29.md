### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:
- I think I am feeling pangs of loneliness... just a bit. Things I can do:
	- Prioritize seeing people in person
		- Study in welcoming, populated spaces (like sid rich or Jaimala's house)
		- Reach out to friends who are on campus and would want to hang out (like Lily and MiVi)
		- Do something nice with people you will see (like Steph)
		- Schedule things! Like for Late Night and Farmer's Market, first Wed is Sept. 4

	- Remember you aren't alone :)
	- Far away support
		- Reach back to people who reached you first (Luis and Connor)
