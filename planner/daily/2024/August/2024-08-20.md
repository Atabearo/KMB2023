		If I didn't let emotions control me, I would be open for the day. I would talk to the new students who might be nervous, and catch up with the ones who I will recognize from last year. I would just be curious. Stay curious.

### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

What were some good things today?
- I enjoyed getting to chat with Dr. Bowden. That's how I should approach other people; he showed interest in my summer, so I will show interest in theirs. Genuine!! Curiosity!!!!!
- Talking with Jaimala. It is really good she enjoys my company, and I believe her wholeheartedly. 
- I got to talk with MiVi and Diamond -- it is cute that she thought of me, she really does whatever she likes. Diamond bought her camera.
- I wanted to give up on the erg so many times, but I stayed on for the 5000m! If there is any exercise in doing something despite current emotions, it's staying on a dam rowing machine. I AM a rower. I will be on the rowing team.

I think I get stopped up and faltered more on my call with Ethan. Focusing on the very close thing that I can control, how should I go about this?

I don't want to avoid him and I still, even though I am afraid, I don't want to let this emotion, this fear, stop me from going after something I want. 
> Make a plan.

Or plan later.
