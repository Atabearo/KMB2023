### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

Important things
- clean space
- internship
- TMDAS
- AMCAS apply

Fumbles:
- so much shonen jump
- freaky webtoon
- my screen time jumped 8 hrs -- is this happiness?

Other things to think about:
- Shaping up. I know it's 1:30am now, but I should try to keep my check list. Approaching life better starts with a good foundation. If we want to get this stuff done, try finding better ways to cope with difficulty
- Steph crying
- Noel reaching out 
- What to do when I feel like opening deadening scroll time... I didn't need it when I was on the Missouri trip, I couldn't even text my closest mates
