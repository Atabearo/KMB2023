- internship debacle
- car incident
- hang out with Emily
- give it to Sam's, buy tires
- meet Pauline
- day at Sam's 
- take it to auto repair
- Linda hangout
- Ethan offers to take me to Waco
- ???!
- Diamond and Ethan bring me to Waco
- It's 2am, Luis is calling, Angel is picking me up

>Yesterday was a hectic day. I woke up with a pit of dread in my stomach, feeling unheard and not wanting to act up and lose my internship. I texted Ethan that morning, and then Ghia afterwards. I wasn't going to let the $7.54 practicum debacle get in the way of my plans, so I texted Emily too, as we had been planning to meet up. 
After clearing up the debacle, I ate at the Little Kitchen with Emily.
