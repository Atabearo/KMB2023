### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:

- Steph and hope
	[[I am a hopeless romantic]], and I rather get hurt as a fool than hurt others foolishly
- God totally gots me üêüü™ô
	I am worried about a lot of things -- apps and love and friends
	But trust? I felt like I was protected when I laid it all in God's hands. I either could meander through my day doing it my way or I can keep within God's will everyday and know that I will be all right
- Diamond was telling me how it is really nice that I can get along with everyone and people love having me around. It was pretty good compliment to hear
	She noticed how people like taking them along with me (like how I stayed with Josh over the summer)
	How my friends are always calling me over the break
	How I got along well with Emily
- Being generous with my time
	Outpost work
	Talking with Linda
- Am excited for medical school??? Esp if I do get in w research
- Windows down screaming Die Young
- Today WAS a really good day, even if I wasn't impressed by the time I was midway through. A lot happened
