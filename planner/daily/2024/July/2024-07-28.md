### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:
My goals and ambitions: 
- I want to become a *doctor*.
- I want to live each day *well*, at the end to say *I'm proud of what I did.

#### What happened yesterday?
I tell others I am content with this life and I am happy. But my happy circumstances cover my lack--I am dying today. I nearly failed to live, much less to my true [[Heart's Desires (8-5)]]. Aimless and adrift, without a goal even to enjoy the world and it's pleasures to any height--I sink into the ground.
	This is no way to live.

Following up on that [[change of heart]]-- I think that day is the exact opposite of what it would look like to follow after God's heart. I don't want to feel so *deadened to the world* that I ignore people who reach out to me and hide from people in real life. *I lost myself.*
And I've been losing myself for a while. I stop doing things, I go off and feel empty, and then I do a little thing to revive, but it never lasts long. It's a sad place to be. I'm not only stagnating but I am feeling worse as a being.
	How would I keep myself from falling off the edge again? What actions should I take to be better. 

**Start with a foundation**. What would I do if I were in my ideal planning mode:
- [x] to-do list
- [x] day plan
- [x] reflect on day
- [x] plan the next day
- [x] reflect on life
- [x] set alarms before sleep

If I set what I need to do, then I just have to do them. Alarms keep me on time. If anything goes as not expected, reflect and plan a new day. By spending time getting to know myself, I make sure I am aligned with myself and my long-term plans.
