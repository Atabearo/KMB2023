### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:
[[Notice board (8-1)]]
###### Notice: I tend to go MIA on friends.
###### Notice: I don't understand things that I love, so I am not able to explain them to others.
###### Notice: I haven't had a true task to test my ability to manage the youth. And I want that.

Today I was beginning to feel sad and unmotivated. But instead of doing something comfortable and that I knew would pass time quickly, I reached out to [[Josh]] with an intent of gratitude, thank you for showing me the way around a gym. It was the best decision of my day, and I was so re-energized afterwards. 

I called [[Ethan]] last night after his volleyball game. One thing that I took away from that long call was that the thought behind sweet sentimental activities like sharing personal treasures is that "this is valuable to me, and I want to share that experience with you". He talked about upgrading his common area with a desk and mused about an L-shaped desk so that we can both study together. So casually. If I'm right in my interpretation, I can't help but smile to think that he enjoys my company too, and is wanting to fit me in his life like that. 
- In our future we may be drawing together as a hangout, drawing and just chatting, maybe doing a challenge. Neither of us have drawn in years, it'll be so fun!
- He does not have an idea how to generate creative fun things or hang-outs like that. "I can barely come up with ideas for a date!" --> therefore, take him on a date? 👀
	S'like pick up at taco truck, eat at the park, free ice cream, go to petco and see the animals, get free stuff at popshelf, do some chores and drop off old electronic junk at best buy, watch a movie, maybe eat at a place he likes. Good day
- Now I feel like calling him. This is very warming, having these feelings. I want to tell him about my day, oops, and hear about his. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.

If I have a weak grasp on *what I am doing*, I can't explain what I put so much time into. It's embarrassing.

This is the most important thing that I can do for myself, to understand the fundamentals of everything. Breaking it down into smaller parts. [[true understanding]].
