### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:
- My LEGS HURT I think the gym is working
- I stayed up talking to Luis, a guy who has wonder at the core of his being. I really do like having him as a friend. At this point in my life I am just glad that I am not suffering as much as I did this time last year. I don't think I ever knew him all that well when we were friends last year, it's only now that I am understanding deeply who he is and the things that influence him
- My desires are strong! I do want to settle my lower lingering desire loops quickly, but meditate on the ones that bring me to wholeness.
- I think I'll ask to hang out with Ethan on Thurs/Fri, and maybe we can go out this weekend as well?
- Maybe I should see Eyram while I'm in Houston
- Check on Lily, Trisha should be done with hell week, Mahita should be in Austin... 
- I'm seeing Emily on Wednesday!!!
