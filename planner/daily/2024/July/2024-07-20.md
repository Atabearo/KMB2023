### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:
Day....
	2:30 am and the night is lit by the cool-toned keys under my fingers and lights of the electric fly lamps.
	...
	11:40am, and I have missed my meeting. All is not fun, fresh, and swaggy.
	6:18pm. I have cleaned 3 transcripts total today, 4 hours since lunch. Long day, and now it is gym time???!

- Aside from that though, I have been well today. I got to cook for an hour and eat my meal prep marinade (cooked), and [[Susan]] called! Connor conencted for a bit, too. He's on his way to Florida, and me and Susan are working.  From there I texted [[Steph]] a bit. I missed her as a friend. She is right that I am MIA most of the time, but I don't realize how much I miss my friends until I see them again.
- I think talking to these two makes me smile, even if they didn't particularly do anything :) It's why I made the [[Coping belt (7-30)]] list (see [[talking to a friend]]).

| 7-20 (12pm)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 7-20 (afternoon)                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| I feel a little bit anxious whenever I say something, and the conversation dies immediately after. It makes me think I am putting the other person in a mentally difficult place, which is not my intention. (From the desire of being esteemed, deliver me. At this time, I acknowledge that I have a desire to be liked by others.) | I ended up calming myself down by the end of the day, but this was a big overreaction to *not doing anything wrong*. I don't KNOW what was up at that time, but I didn't say anything difficult. |
