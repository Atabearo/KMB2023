### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

12:27: I think I should stop expressing emotions I don't feel, when I am texting other people... It kind of sucks. Either that sucks, or I am just feeling down in general.

>>>

What do I want to do with this? What am I wondering? What questions do I have for myself that only I can answer?
- What to do when I feel so heavy for no reason
- Things to talk about when I eventually call someone
- Anything interesting? Did anything surprise me?

I also want to take this time to relax and not think about anything I have to do...

>>>

9:12, the next day:

I can't believe how much fun I was having towards the end.
	After the library bonding time with Linda, I began to putter on my own. I was gonna draw... maybe crochet and watch YouTube... and Luis called me, so I started talking to him at the end of the day. 
	When Sammy came home, she called me out of my room, so that's where I started working.
