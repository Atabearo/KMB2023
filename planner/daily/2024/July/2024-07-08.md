### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

It isn't nighttime yet, but there is a hurricane today. I watched the power go out at 6am, as well as the prospects that I would be able to get my milk and yogurt from HEB later that day. I met [[God]] in the dark. And I had a clear mind and an open day. I started on my TMDSAS essay before going back to sleep, waking at noon. The power was still out. [[Sammy]] was cooking in the kitchen. She came in and offered me rice to a shocked second from me, but it was so much brighter out in the kitchen than the master bedroom, so I went out. Good chats with Linda and Sammy. Sammy is a brave girl; she is working the American way of life, she goes after everything she wants by working really hard. 140 hours in two weeks is insane.
