Live the examined life! Life is worth living. 
At the end of that day to say I'm proud of what I did. *I'm proud of myself.

### task list
- [ ] I'm proud of myself
### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:

I think I found my problem,
it's that I am so self-conscious. When I am out, it's like I have a constant stream of thoughts fighting against me while I am listening to others. I van hear what they're saying and I am also listening to a stream of things I should be doing coming from myself. It's exhausting. So if I am wondering where all this yap is coming from and how people can be so funny, it's probably because they are comfortable enough to do so. I don't have an issue with expression. I have trouble getting OUT OF MY OWN HEAD. 

It's ugly being alone with my thoughts because it's so isolating!
And I rather be in silence because I can't step into spaces as myself.
I become "less me" every time I sit in my own head and tire myself out with my internal monologue of comparison and what they must think of me.

I don't like who I become -- someone who is thinking only of themself is a selfish person.

Now that 

There is many errors with how I am thinking.
