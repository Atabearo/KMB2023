### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

I thought, "I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get up" <<< I felt resistant to start the day and look through what I had to do. It happens from time to time. We did get up and keep going, and this is part of the 2 hours to "wake up!"
	People enlist in the military and forcibly build up their diligence. People are in medical/dental school right now. I want to go to professional school. So how should I wake up in the day?
*{The answer is to be seen}*

Whatchu thinking?
- I have been anxious about my phone, I did see that I got a text back. My anxiety is informing me there is a threat, but I am completely safe. Not only am I safe situationally, but this is a person who has shown himself to be understanding and compassionate.
	- I was all dramatic about it, but in plainspeak, I wish I could play with you guys! I am sad to miss it but look forward to the future if it were to be a repeating event
- Not doing my applications makes me feel like I'm not doing enough. It feel afraid. And, I am ashamed that I let myself run into my deadline like that.
	- *{The answer is to be seen}
	- I think I ought to internalize these feelings and prioritize working over my fun things. (Trisha and Via barred, those are mandatory fun things)
- Seeing Diamond and Steph together made me feel ???? less than well. 
	- But it shouldn't. Everything was OK.
- I'm grateful to MiVi because of how welcoming she is, so she deserves egg container.
- I'm getting more responsibilities for research.
	- I should thank Dr. Y! (Leadership book tells me that we should make people feel appreciated)
	- I'm scared of losing time, but **I have the time**.
- Ethan brought up bucket list he's excited for the future (once he finishes studying)
	- Like skydiving
- There are things I want to talk to him about?
	- He's right -- self-esteem/confidence is learned
	- What he finds unique about Christianity (I become close-minded and stop listening sometimes)
	- Autumn Moon? is coming
	- I don't think you dislike me
		- Being more honest with feelings
- As always,
	- Jaimala is a good friend. She came in clutch for me for SAS class.
	- I like bantering with people!
		- With Ela and Rebecca and Mattie it was a good time. It doesn't need to be all the time, but I am glad I could do that.

###### So what shall I focus on today?
- Having a good time with MiVi!
- Make sure I get to show my appreciation
	- I joined VSA bc of her
	- and also she is my sun
- That's all for today. I just want to have a good time (and my apps WILL have to wait until tomorrow)
