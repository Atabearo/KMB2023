### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

I think the fact that I woke up excited about a text wrecked my dopamine reward system and had me not focusing for the first two hours of my day
- new rule: no phones right after waking up... 4:45-6:45, reaccess phone function after
And I had a dream, combo of reading webtoon, youtube (HG saying to reveal your feelings) and getting a text
- It was us in a group, and I am in my first relationship. We explore the new dynamic. He is stunning.

This is also the impossible? Going to disclose that I find him very lovely and have a lot of feelings that probably constitute a crush. What do you think? Or what do you think I should do?

Gotta write something because the thoughts are still in my head
- [ ] NO phone when I wake up!
- [x] When I wake up... I will go to the living room and pray
