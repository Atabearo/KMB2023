### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

- I'd like to sleep peacefully
- I appreciate that I have connected with so many people as to get wished happy birthday
- I am sad that I didn't get the courage to talk to Ethan
- I love my friends
- I think Via and Trisha understand who I am
- I've been anxious when I am quiet, but I realize that they are having a good time whether I talk to them or not
- I hope he still wants to go to Mass with me
