### üìù How was the day, whatchu thinking:
Yesterday:
- Changing any free time I had before (Cow) with rowing and sleep (good)
	- It's a good thing I was budgeting my time, or else I never would have seen it
- Ate and passed out
- Leadership class next
- Lily helped me swim later!!
- Feeling like I have a friend group again, with Jenny and MiVi and Susu
- Diamond RETURNS and it feels like a part of my home
- Glad my friend (MiVi) supports me and encourages me as the BEST COX
- I texted Ethan before I went to sleep... right before I was going to log off, he replied
	- He's tired. And struggling with academic sctuff. And doing a lot.

Today:
- I woke up today thinking of him, it happens I guess when we text
	- If there was anything I could do to help him, I would want to know. I know he would do the same if our positions were switched
	- And I thought about my power to take initiative and do something that we would both enjoy, something I can do? And just ask him if I can sit closer. And then once I'm there, I can get comfortable
		- It would take a load off my mind honestly and would make me more comfortable talking
		- And I hope it would be a "life-giving", energizing experience for him
- CREW -- met Carolina (premed real estate junior), Anne (sophomore business major) who is friends with ------, solid with Molly, there is Julian who was giving erg advice, Alexa who is bright and med-tall, Kariss, Alice who is not eating and lives a mile off campus
