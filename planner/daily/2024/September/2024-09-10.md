### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

I want to facilitate healthy little treats
- Scrolling IG 
	- Post: been noticing this weird thing where if I eat high protein foods in the middle of the day instead of pretzels and candy, I don't need a 90 minute nap every single afternoon like usual. Sadly we'll never know if there is a connection
	- TheTastyK: one of those plant-based, high protein ppl who posted her favorite healthy treats
	- Post: Dopamine menu to give options to your brain
-  1000Essays podcast: Routine == habitualness -> mood -> nurture aspect of personality ([[a healthy routine is a foundation for a life lived well]])
- Desires
	- to take care of myself and the ones I love
	- to eat tasty things
	- to cook and share tasty treats
	- to provide source of regularity and joy to myself and ones I love
	- to develop my personality with evidence (such as this nurture aspect)

The front desk lady at the BUCC was enjoying yogurt like she's never eaten yogurt in her life and honestly that is how we should be living. She's from San Diego!
