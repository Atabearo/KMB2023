### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

- I talked to Connor and Luis about telling Ethan I liked him romantically and that helped a lot with the processing 
	It took BALLS to do that and yes it was nerve wracking. 
	I'm sorry for always cutting Luis off and it is so that it annoys him too, so I will only call him/pick up the phone if I am free!!!
- But I woke up today and my mind was so clear
	I will probably have more interesting/shareable thoughts, and be able to use more of my brainpower?
	Having a crush for me was like having a major mental handicap
- Now to the day!
