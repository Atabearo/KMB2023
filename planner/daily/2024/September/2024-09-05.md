### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:

Thank you Lily, for making sure to communicate that you were leaving to me and possibly implying/leaving it open that you could come to practice for one more day.

I'm not upset at you, I'm just sad because {certain actions} made me feel . (It's in the same vein of that I was never mad at Mahita, I was just frustrated at her behavior)


I'm thinking that I am not very emotionally giving as a person -- to my detriment. 

Is it normal to not tell people about things unless they ask?
