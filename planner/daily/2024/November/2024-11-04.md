### üìù how was the day, whatchu thinking:

The life we live is a story, and the writing process is in the way we live and who we become. 

My acknowledgement that you were one who I know contributed so much in my writing process.
- It is a blessing and my joy that you can receive this.

Reminder that I am just one woman embedded in a story going ages past and continuing into an age to come. 

A reminder that you beautiful and so loved!
