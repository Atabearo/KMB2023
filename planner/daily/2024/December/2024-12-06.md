I'm still afloat!

Lord, 
- I am aware I don't love others as I should. I am aware that there are those around me who need care, but I have shown that I don't have the heart to act. I have a fair amount of genuine guilt.
- And a fair amount of toxic shame. I believe I am good enough for you, and I come to you, but still I not only behold myself to the admiration/disapproval of others, but put upon myself a weight that others don't even hold against me. A fabricated guilt when in truth, I did not do anything wrong. So why do I bow my head? Why should I avert my eyes?
- A part of me believes I am not enough or not doing enough to warrant being around others. A part of me prefers the idea of you rather than the reality of seeing you face to face.

(He'd be happy to see me and regardless of anything what I can do, he is walking with God. Vice versa: regardless of anything he could do, I am walking with God)
