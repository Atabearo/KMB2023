### üìù how was the day, whatchu thinking:

I feel overwhelmed with emotion when I have the thought that things are different for us now. It's a silly thing to cry about now that we are both closer to God than we had been. I miss him, but I don't think I am ready to reach out yet. Maybe as a prayer partner, I've been asking Him if I should and I think the answer is that it would be a good thing. 

My pride slows me down and causes me to shy away.
