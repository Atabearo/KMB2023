### üìù how was the day, whatchu thinking:

no one can do this but me, right now.

Things that got me moving:
- phone call
- playing a song
- surprise! alarm goes off
- weighing the pros/cons of lying back down
- return to love (can't love unless I sacrifice, unless I work)

Cried a bunch today:
- thinking about my "true desires"
	- Bringing my actual desires felt like coming to God like a selfish child
	- I want what's best for me, or at least I want what's right for me and to not want what I don't have
		- I don't want the mental conflict, I don't want to feel like I'm failing my friend
- thinking about failing Ethan as a friend
- thinking about Jesus as a man who loves me dearly and thinks it was all worth it to die for
