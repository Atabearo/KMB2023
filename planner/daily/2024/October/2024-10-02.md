### 📝 How was the day, whatchu thinking:


#### Get this off my chest...
I didn't lose anything, that is true.
What I am most sad about is that this recent event was a culmination over a long time of repeated action -- it was inevitable. I've been getting increasingly nervous since the summer, and that's when we started to meet in person and see that our time together was spent mostly in silence. I couldn't rally myself to talk to him like any friend would, so it only makes sense that he would save his time and energy.

I am very grateful we have this habitual, 1 hour thing together. I can start building up myself to at least bring him a bit of levity and joy in two 10 minute car rides.
