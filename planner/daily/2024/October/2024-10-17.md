### "How to make friends when you are depressed"
- how to lessen the impact of your depression on your social relationships
	- Don't self-pity
	- Don't make it the topic of conversation
It feels like...
	"Most days, you don‚Äôt feel like reaching out to people‚Äîyou just want to curl inward and just clam up." 
	"It is tough. They may not have sufficient energy/initiatve to reach out to others. They may feel worthless and wonder why anyone would want to be friends with them. Realistically, they may worry about whether they are capable of keeping up their side of the friendship, realizing they may not be good company right now"
Realize...
"But once I realized things weren't going to improve if I just focus on myself and being selfishly focused on my own hurt and emotions... I started to realize others had their hurts and emotions too, and I should also minister to them in their times of need."
I learned to...
	"be humble and look past myself and see others for who they really were."
	"I began to depend less on myself for being the solution for everything"
	"learning to ask questions and receive advice and comfort from others"
"It takes time, humility, and dedication, but I believe it's possible to reach out to others when one is depressed!"

### Who am I when nobody is watching?
