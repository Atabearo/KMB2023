Live the examined life! Life is worth living. 
At the end of that day to say I'm proud of what I did. *I'm proud of myself.

### üìù how was the day, whatchu thinking:

I don't want to live.
	*really?*
I might want to live. Life is meaningful and beautiful, but when I think about becoming someone I want to be... I feel too much psychological shit.
I am going to keep living at any rate, so I should just do the best I can. If I chose to die at the beginning of today, I wouldn't have dotten to see the blue in the sky or talk to Jae.
	Would I live for these things? 
I am curious for what tomorrow brings, and as long as I stay curious, I will keep living.


Purpose, belonging, service.
	How can I serve others?
