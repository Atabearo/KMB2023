##### 💭 How are my thoughts? Are they serving me or holding me back?
- I am a little bit too preoccupied over a single person (and it's not my Lord and Savior), which isn't good for me. I'd like to practice thinking other things in the morning.
##### 🔖Write to remember something from today:
- Yesterday mom and I were on the couch. She was a little bit upset today. The big things--the house, the staff-- that were happening, all the communication and flack falls on her. The staff want a raise and Dad rather hire new staff and is very stubborn about the situation. Nicole found out about the Chicago property because the problem resident dropped off rent to the office. Later we were talking about medicine, and I can see how passionate she is about that. It's a thankless job in general, but she showed me the comments her patients left, new ones she didn't know existed. Made sure I read all of them (she is really proud of them!). She looked most alive when talking about clinical psychopathology, and how I should be reading about this stuff in my free time. 1, its interesting, and 2, it was something that she wished she did so that she could have a knowledge framework to build off of. So, the next lesson to follow the heart was the eye. How she spoke of the eye systematically showed me how she thinks. 
- Today Luis asked me to ask my parents about what to do if his little cousin had a fever. I could see my mom act in doctor mode for this (for her) hypothetical 1 y/o girl.
##### ⛅ What do you want to take with you into the future? Even tomorrow?

### BIAY Day 1:
##### Gs 1-2
- God said, and it was so, and it was good.
- Creation of man
	- Because of God's sheer goodness,
	- God, infinitely content in himself, freely created us to share in his blessed life (CCC ?) 
	- image and likeness: the source of our dignity
- Purpose of man: If we are made in God's image, what are we to do?
	- LABOR: "The Lord God took the man and out him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it." (Gs 2:15). Have dominion over the land. 
	- LEISURE: Rest like God
	- LOVE: Suitable "helpmate" (ezer kenegdo)
##### Psalm 19 
A meditation that creation is good and God has given us a law (that is good). "O Lord, my rock and redeemer".
#### Bible Journal:
[[God is good]]. God worked, rested, and loved.
[[the foundation of reality is goodness]]. 
Humanity is made good. Humanity is made in God's likeness, the [[image of God]]. Man's original purpose was to [[Labor, Leisure, and Love]].

Therefore, I am good. My purpose is to be like God.
##### Personal reflection:
Lord, help me to be more like you. I want to know you better, and start reading your Word, humanity's story-- a story you revealed to me, too. Help me today to be in accordance with your will, so that I may steward my time and treasures for the greater glory of God (AMDG).
