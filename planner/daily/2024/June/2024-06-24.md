##### 💭 How are my thoughts? Are they serving me or holding me back?
- They are still a bit to wrangle. I was thinking about [[first fruits]] this morning, and if I see where those went, they went to my own ends. I was meditating, basically, on something imaginary happiness. (Sorry you had to see that God, my heart betrays me and I fail to choose you.)
- Shifting cognition to action, I did take a shower and get moving. I continued BIAY after this camping weekend.
##### 🔖Write to remember something from today:
- 
- June 20: Luis was talking about his ex explicitly for the first time. Honestly, the way he talks about her? I find myself wishing that they didn't have to go through such a hard break, and end up in a place they don't talk anymore. They are both the most intelligent people they ever met to each other, and that she is a complement to him? Even by herself she is an incredible artist, an academic weapon (the same field too!), and a type of person that everyone loves.
	- "I think that the type I tend to fall in love with are wonderful people, people that everyone loves"
		- I guess she carries a lot of anger still from that time, and feelings for him. The suggestion that he'd be a better fit for her than her current boyfriend be kind of funny if it wasn't so sad. 
		- I think I loosely fit his type, but when I hear about her, I think I feel more comfortable admitting that there are definitely better people for him out there than me-- especially if he is looking for people who are smarter than he is! Bro is going to MD Anderson. There's gonna be compassionate and intelligent ppl
	- He's always in a position where a girl always likes him more than he likes her, he has just not had that much respect or trust for another girl before. He thinks he'll temper down after he find the One, after which he can stop being such a heartbreaker.
##### ⛅ What do you want to take with you into the future? Even tomorrow?
