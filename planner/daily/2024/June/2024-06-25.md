###  📅 Daily Questions 

##### 💛 What good shall I do today?
- Lord, I thank you and I love you for this time with you today. Help me to walk with you today.
- I pray for a remembrance of you, because I must be able to pray for our relationship before praying on the behalf of others. I found that I was a little bit jealous of what Ethan has found with you when I was sad and weak, but I know I have the same right to you as he does. Help me to seek you and know you, so that I may be ale to bring a little more of your presence in the world through me.
- Thank you for being with Steph as well, I pray for my friends and family to be well.
##### 💌 I am grateful for...
- God (for His mercy endures forever). He's been allowing me to be awake for Steph, without fail. I haven't been sleeping all the way through the night, and it is so that whenever she calls I am ready for her. I am really grateful for that.

##### 💭 How are my thoughts? Are they serving me or holding me back?
- I still gave my "first fruits" to a false happiness. But I did think about it this time.
##### 🔖Write to remember something from today:
- I had been so itchy that I had to get up immediately. Steph texted me at 1:30am last night and I got up to get medicine and saw her message right on the dot. We called... she wanted to update me about her parting with Noel, the talk they had before they officially went no contact. It went well, and she is no longer anxious. She is also someone in the know about Ethan, probably the closest link (a degree removed) to being someone who actually knows him and knows that I see him as a romantic prospect. I told her about AJR, she told me about her bread, we talked about Diamond and trips and Abakada shorts and all the good things.
##### ⛅ What do you want to take with you into the future? Even tomorrow? 
- BIAY and journaling. I think it is doing me a lot of good.
