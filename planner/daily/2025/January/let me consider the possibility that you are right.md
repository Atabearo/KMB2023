> Think about this:

It’s relatively easy to understand another person when it comes to things you agree on. Things we agree on are often the basis of a friendship in the first place. Why is someone your friend? Most likely it’s because you have “things in common”. You feel comfortable with them because of these common things.

But what about when you don’t agree? That’s when it gets more difficult to understand each other. There’s less comfort, and the more important to each of you the subject of the disagreement is, the greater the discomfort can be.

Here’s something I learned recently.

A friend said that people can fall in love only once. That sounded very wrong to me, so I said, “I disagree.” I had identified and acknowledged something I didn’t understand about him. It happens. I sort of thought that would be the end of it.

But it wasn’t. He was firmly convinced, and said so. Oh. Now what? Generally in such a situation, I’d think, “OK; we’ll ‘agree to disagree’”, and move on.

This time I had a different thought. I respect this person. Why not consider the possibility that he could be right? (After all, wasn’t I sitting there thinking he really ought to consider the possibility that I could be right?) So. Suppose people can fall in love only once. What would that mean in my own life? What would be the consequences of it? How would the world be different?

I discovered, to my surprise, that one thing it would mean in my life was: if we can only fall in love once, then I have never been in love.

Wow.

He, on the other hand, had been in love once, and it didn’t work out. The one time it can happen was over. Used up.

Wow.

I still didn’t believe the premise. But by exploring that if/then, I suddenly got a glimpse of what it would be like if I did.
