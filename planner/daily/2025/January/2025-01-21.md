Remember:
	Receive all with joy, and know your desires are heard and cared for. *All glory be*.
	At the end of that day I want to say I gave from my heart.

### üìù how was the day, whatchu thinking:

one good thing about me, one good thing about another, one good thing in the world:
1. I found something to help me get up in the morning: possibly running and box friend. I am strong!
	1. Even if I can't get it all done, I did connect with others today.
2. Dhanvi is presenting at the STEM fair tmr. Janvi is getting into Pinterest.
3. In a collective, the sum is greater than the parts. And I can enjoy living the life I want to live as a motivator to protect the things I love. Cultivating love...

Questions:
- What are the daily joys of others?
- Will this poetry also elicit an emotional reaction from another, the way it affected me?
- What behaviors would benefit from the reframing of "making a difference, creating a utopia" to doing it for the sake of adding something positive into the world?
