##### I struggled a lot with self-image this month. 
- Start of the month: didn't like myself, attention is on the most negative part of myself. She is sad
	- Labor Day pool party social with FSA; was freaked out and set an intent
	- Journaling helps like a hype session
- Feeling very lonely
	- "I'm not worth the time" "Doing it all alone-- It helps that I also don't readily share my emotions" [[2024-09-06]] 
##### Methodical changes
- Started tracking my time through the month
##### Becoming more social
- Significant change in comfort in groups since freshman year == change in confidence
	CREW, 
- found a friend group in MiVi's group
- 

#### Questions I had
- "why can't I be more like them? ... How do I become the 'me' that I do like, and feel like I can accomplish the things I want? How do I get into that state of being?' [[2024-09-02]]
- "Is it normal to not tell people about things unless they ask?" [[2024-09-05]]
