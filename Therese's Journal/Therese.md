### Identity: I am capable of doing good things
- I am a beloved child of God.
	> I see myself as God sees me; a wonderful daughter. I am in a loving relationship with Him, and entrust Him with my heart and life. I am not anxious or nervous about trivial things, but give cheerfully. In all the day, I seek to do His will. I exist with the intent to *live*.
- I am a social, caring person.
> 	I am the type of person who initiates conversation with her peers and goes out of her way to make others feel comfortable and included. I go out of my way to inhabit common areas and care for my loved ones. I communicate my feelings. My loved ones are important to me, and strangers are a part of me I do not know yet.
- I am someone you can trust, reliable and consistent.
	> I am someone who takes care of their health and well-being; I make time to move my body, to take care of my mental, and the environment I live in. 
	> You can trust me to do my work in a timely manner. I am accountable for myself, and act on what I should do rather than how I feel.
