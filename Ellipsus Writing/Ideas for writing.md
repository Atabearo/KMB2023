### Faith Writes
- What I learned from 50 days of praying the entire Rosary (10/6)
	- Trying it yourself
		- Didn't finish the Rosary! Therese trust in God, that He is pleased with our efforts, like a child falling asleep talking with its mother. Our angel, the saints praying with us, finishes it. The merits and grace from even one Our Father or one Hail Mary said with faith. 
	- I've done this before
		- And it changed my desires, and I got the grace I prayed for (even if I am not stronger)
		- Everything led me to live the Little Way and Offering to Divine Mercy even before I knew it
- >> Why pray the Rosary?
- >> Lectio Divina Rosary (10/6)
	- Marrying Gospel meditation with powerful meditative prayer 
	- Rosary = walking with Mary through Jesus' life and "Mysteries" of Jesus' life
	- All of Jesus' life is worth drawing wisdom from, worth "pondering in the heart"
	- Form
		- Lectio: Read short passage from the Gospel.
		- Meditatio: Reflect on where God has brought your attention, and listen to what God may be saying to you.
		- Oratio: "I offer You, O Lord, this Mystery of the {event of Jesus' life}. I ask of thee, through this Mystery and through the intercession of Thy Blessed Mother, for {particular grace or spiritual gift}."
		- Contemplatio: as you pray the Rosary, let your mind be at rest.

## Self-persuasive reflections
- [[On friendship and nurturing the ties God has called me to]]
	- [ ] Luis talking with Ushna?
	- [ ] What changed?
## Discursive lines of thought that made the page
- Thinking to make a **causal loop diagram** for the valuable things in life 
	- [ ] 🔦 survey: will my other Christians have the same conclusions? 🔦 (10/21)
		- yes, bc when we break it down we get the same essential Gospel message
		- but no, bc unique individuals, unique relationships === different spiritualities 
			- Little and weak, but God loves His little ones
			- A pitiful, broken bird with the heart of an eagle; the Little Way 
				- Marked by poverty of soul. Emph on faith as trust, complete dependence
				- God calls us to love as he did. Always be a weak, pitiful lover, so to love God as he loves me I would need to borrow His merciful love to do so 
					- Way of a child
					- Where your treasure is, there your heart shall be. That your actions merit grace on earth and a treasure that does not decay in heaven
					- Like the Levites, who had not inheritance but God (empty-handed into heaven)
				- Do little things with extraordinary love; it may look like nothing and often feel like nothing, but believe what God has said nonetheless (the "eyes of faith")
					- We walk among God's beloved, taking care of our ordinary relationships and duties is a transformative stewardship, that prayer transforms and blesses, every morning is a glorious opportunity to save the world, God holds you in existence with his love
						- Way of darkness,
				- Taking on God's justice to bless others and console Jesus, or taking on the excess mercy of God to console Him
	- preceded by thoughts on (10/10):
		- importance of social health (social determinant with the weight of cigarettes) and relationships
			- you can't make old friends
			- [ ] asking Mattie and company to help me think through it, instead of making it by myself
		- meditations on what is rich to God
			- proverbs on stewarding relationships (cattle, wife, son, daughter, friends. see Sirach #:##)
	- *life is fragile*, *time and attention are all we have*
- How rivalry is the most (intense form of encouragement, contending to best another and becoming our best; 10/21)
	- like "common goals" (writing group) but with stakes, driven to keep going
- What I learned from writing group
	- an essay of epic proportions and tenuous logic dressed in haute fashion (like "milk and cereal"), I wouldn't have written
		- learned to write something that I know about, something that draws from my experience or what I am pursuing
		- how to write a narrative
- [x] Marie has 2 cats and the applique of ghosts and pumpkins keeps a lady young at heart
	- I learned that by trying to make strangers smile. *Talk to strangers*. It's worth it.
- General appreciation for Catholic teaching on stewarding creation
	- In spite of all human evil, *on a foundational level, creation is very good*; *Existence is good*, because God holds all things in being (in thought, actively sustained -- opposite of "clockmaker God" notion)
- [x] In recent news: Hallmark's "Adventures in Love and Birding" offends the birding community (10/11)
	- In general, birders are always annoyed watching the inaccuracies of bird representation in movies (ex: wrong sounds for birds, not-native bird sounds to location)
		- worst fumble, failing to capture excitement of spotting bird you wanted to see for a long time, anti-climatic
		- imagining the birder watch party is hilarious
	- this is how I felt reading "The Love Hypothesis" tbh -- this girl is *not* sound like she loves "doing science"
- Must be tough to raise an American kid, don't know how good they have it (10/6).
	- *the importance of passing down stories and memories*, *generational memory is short*, *learn from past mistakes!* on a generational/societal scale
