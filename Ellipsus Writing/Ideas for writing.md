### Faith Writes
- What I learned from 50 days of praying the entire Rosary (10/6)
	- Trying it yourself
		- Didn't finish the Rosary! Therese trust in God, that He is pleased with our efforts, like a child falling asleep talking with its mother. Our angel, the saints praying with us, finishes it. The merits and grace from even one Our Father or one Hail Mary said with faith. 
	- I've done this before
		- And it changed my desires, and I got the grace I prayed for (even if I am not stronger)
		- Everything led me to live the Little Way and Offering to Divine Mercy even before I knew it
- >> Why pray the Rosary?
- >> Lectio Divina Rosary (10/6)
	- Marrying Gospel meditation with powerful meditative prayer 
	- Rosary = walking with Mary through Jesus' life and "Mysteries" of Jesus' life
	- All of Jesus' life is worth drawing wisdom from, worth "pondering in the heart"
	- Form
		- Lectio: Read short passage from the Gospel.
		- Meditatio: Reflect on where God has brought your attention, and listen to what God may be saying to you.
		- Oratio: "I offer You, O Lord, this Mystery of the {event of Jesus' life}. I ask of thee, through this Mystery and through the intercession of Thy Blessed Mother, for {particular grace or spiritual gift}."
		- Contemplatio: as you pray the Rosary, let your mind be at rest.
