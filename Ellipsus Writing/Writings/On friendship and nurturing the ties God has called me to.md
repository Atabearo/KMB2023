Considering the reasons why I should reach out to Ethan (and invest in our friendship)

#### Why: fair grounds
Our friendship made me happy. There's a foundation for shared interest, understanding, and growth.
I want to tell him about my little things and ask him questions of all sorts, including faith and friendship
I want to share in his life and for him to share in mine.

*Even if* it takes some tooling around and I lack the charm and intuition to figure it out gracefully, I know this is one that God calls me for, both he and Ethan will have grace for me.  
*Even if* it does fizzle out, I know God will have us and we will meet again
*Even if* it does lead to heartbreak, I rather be there and happy with him than happy for him.
#### What different: approach with light heart, be funny and frank
I want to **take a lighter heart** with him, be able to laugh at myself and speak frankly (the lightness that Luis has)
- I was unsure how to relate to him. Though, *I can just... be myself??? And do what I want?* 
- I was scared of our intimacy. 
	- All of my WritGro friends have aspect of all-encompassing + intellectually fulfilling
	- (Gal-type friends: Trisha, Luis, Mattie)
		- Would have married them tbh
	- (Mixed: Mahita, Via, Susan)
	- (Guy-type friends: Diamond, Kenneth, MiVi, Lily, Connor)
		- Platonic male friend with that depth of intimacy
			- It is possible!
			- *Never loved anyone with a quality that warrants that behavior* to interference
			- *So hype to get to hear it as it happens when you meet the One*, wife-scoping era
I want to **express my concerns out loud** (in the non-concerning, funny way that Mahita and Trisha do) to him, rather than feel hurt and disconnected
- Before, I didn't believe in my own goodness and know enough how to ask for a perspective that would actually reassure me 
	- (don't see it & this is how you fix it vs understanding & here is what I see) 

#### How/What I Want From Him
- (if he answers, he's free enough *so it is OK to plead for more time?*)
	- if he doesn't answer/call back he's not free/not interested
	- still have to see if short/long calls are preferable
- **to take my calls and texts**
	- I call to talk and share and discuss what I am thinking about, if I am lucky he shares too
		- ask that he shares

- talk with me!!! 
- "I was just thinking of you", in the least-stalkerish way possible
	-  my friends, I have kept them for years bc I contact them 
	- a shame to not contact him when I see ducks

#### When
- now! whenever I think of him, it is the right time because 😌 I have changed my mind on this situation
- thinking I could call frequently once thanksgiving hits
