Quick shoot: at a desk, talking with others, eating at table, (everyday action), brushing teeth, end standing in a dark room

*Maybe I’m crazy, I've been talking to myself at night
And I'm feelin' so alone*
Maybe hugging a pillow?
*If I can get the words out right to tell you how I feel, I might  
But they're comin' out so wrong*

Crying to self. Pained. 

Scene change out of room, light whisps by
*Then the voices, they come rushin' in*  
*Like a ten-ton truck into soft cement*  
Whisps of light floating and bringing attention out, spinning
*Now the words make sense, but I can't repeat*  
Tap on shoulder, offer hand
*Because sense don't make what it used to be*
Pan to both, to J face
*I'm here, my love,* 
spoken by J, smiling, smiling tentatively back
*but I'm*  
worried look down to walking on water's surface
*floating, baby!*

*Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind*
plunge under surface, falling/flipping upwards through the sky in daytime clothes onto a hot air balloon
*You tied a tether here to keep me close*
holding tether in hand, attached to waist
*I've been talkin' to myself on some Icarus spell*
glance up at hot air structure, down at the tether
*But it got better when you didn't go*  
anxious glance over, 
*Oh, tell me when you wanna get out of here*  
squeeze hands on tether like a prayer, and jumping out, falling fast
*And I won't need any more*
Catches her, opens eyes
*Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind*
smile, put down (hand on area where tether was)
*You know I'd really hate to see me float*
hug

*I tremble when I see your eyes; I saw them in a dream last night*  
White eye on dark surface, blink
*And they heard me sing a song*  
smile lines
*I never cared for fancy art or poetry on old guitars*
walking down street, smiling at ordinary things
*But they always sing along*  
facing a crowd at a peopled gathering

*Then the notes fill up like a big balloon*  
floating up 
*As I'm drifting upwards, away from you*  
breathing fast, anxiety
*Now I'm screaming mad with two clenched hands*
bundled hands, panic
*Will beauty come if I don't land?*  
closes eyes
*I'm here, my love, but I'm* 
(white outline on black, holding hand up to touch shoulder)
back at party, another person there. 
*floating, baby!*  
breathing and is OK

*Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind*
*You tied a tether here to keep me close*  
breathing together, walking around same street
*I've been talkin' to myself on some Icarus spell*
Reading a book with her, lounging. she speaks this line:
*But it got better when you didn't go*  
He says.

*Oh, tell me when you wanna get out of here*
*And I won't need any more*  
*Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind*  
*You know I'd really hate to see me float*  

Journal. Pages flipping thru after writing
*Write it to myself at night*  
*As long as you're here, I'll be all*  
"Beloved friend, I wanted to tell you,"
*Write it to myself at night*  
*As long as you're here, I'll be all*
"be with you until the end of the age," (or another promise)
*Write it to myself at night*  
*As long as you're here,* 
"I'll be alright."
*I'll be all alright!*  

Pan to her at desk in the dark, begins floating, surprised. She is OK floating and smiles knowing that he will be there. 
*I'm here, my love, but I—*  
Speaks the line with arms open wide. Pan to eyes close
*I'm here, my love, but I'm*
Both floating, hands together
*floating, baby!*  

(next scene evokes flying together and having the trust that he will not leave her to float)
*Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind*  
*You tied a tether here to keep me close*  
*But it got better when you didn't go*  
*Oh, tell me when you wanna get out of here*  
*And I won't need any more*  
*Hold me down tight when I'm losing my mind*  
*You know I'd really hate to see me float*
