### Solution to attentional difficulties:
- Understanding well enough to teach others
	When learning:
	- Learning at a fundamental/principle level
	- Asking anticipated questions to self, finding out answers
	- Finding out *everything* I "need to know"
- Teach it back!

- Plan:
	Articulate values --> realistic goals --> action
- Implement
- Make time for evaluation
