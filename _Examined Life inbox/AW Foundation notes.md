Where da money go
- $700M affiliation agreement over 30 years to "expand access to health care, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes in the Heartland" with [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/) to provide CV expertise
	- $350M from Mercy to "initially building a new cardiac care center of excellence on Mercy’s campus in Rogers, Arkansas, and resources for additional physician recruitment"
	- Addition $350M to "develop an outpatient center of excellence for specialty care, including new cardiac services and virtual care in Bentonville, and to attract, train, and retain top physicians for the region. This effort represents one of the largest-ever specialty care investments in the Heartland."
	- Support world-class health care, in NWA!

Their initiatives provide great care, reduce the total cost, change the model, focus on preventative, whole health care, attract talented physicians, position NWA to be premier health care destination, and treat patients closer to home (significantly reduce the $950 million currently lost annually due to patients seeking specialty care outside of Northwest Arkansas)

Pique:
how "value-based payment initiatives and edlivery services"
how model of preventative, whole health care
Value of "**transparent, wellness-oriented care is nonnegotiable**", does this tract
	"“We believe that transparent, wellness-oriented care is nonnegotiable,” says Walter Harris, President and CEO, Heartland Whole Health Institute. “Providers and patients alike benefit when the traditional approach to care and physician reimbursement is abandoned for a model that *prioritizes keeping patients healthy and costs down*. This is just the beginning of what we will accomplish together.”"
