*Is this candidate who they say they are? Is this person likely to be a good candidate? A good fit for our first cohort?*

## Objectives:
- Authentically engage medical school interviewers on the key question: "Are we a good fit?"


Priority considerations:
- Know my application inside out
- Prepare general responses, discern valuable considerations from my/their POV
- Taking social cues 
### Conveying myself accurately
- articulate responses
- practice responses
### Relevant topics
- What is [[AWSOM]] looking for in a medical student? What would be important to a newly founded school?
- What makes me a good medical school candidate?
- Why do I want to become a doctor?
- What kind of doctor do I want to become?
- What is important to me in a medical school
	Having the same quality education as an established medical school
	- Step 1 prep
		NBME-based tests instead of writing Qs themselves ("teaching to step 1")
		[[Shelf exams]]?
	- Where are clinical rotations? Established teaching hospitals, are the clinicians used to having students?
		- Established rotation
		- not to far away
		- Do you have to schedule your own rotations?
	- (Is this a dealbreaker for me?)
	- Relationship with administration
		- IMPORTANT bc we are going to give feedback on a new curriculum and would want to see changes based on our suggestions\
		- established does not mean better -- listening to students needs

	- Opinion on mandatory
	Research opportunities
- are they investing heavily in our class? how are they committed to our inaugral class? Expected that first class of students will get a lot of attention form staff


QUALITIES:
- New curriculum
	- May have to go out and learn things on own
	- Innovations not present at other school
- start culture and traditions of the school



### Independent of which medical school I attend:
- Study *independently* for USMLE board exam
	Step 1 
		Typically after M2, perhaps advantage if offered in M3
- B&B, Pathoma, and Sketchy; Amboss, Rx, UWorld, Kaplan, B&B, Pathoma, Sketchy, Anki, Dirty Medicine, OME, etc.

[[I am a medical school applicant]]

- Whenever you confirm your interview date, make sure to politely **express your gratitude** for the opportunity and excitement to learn more about the program. Your “interview” comprises every interaction you have with a given school; that is, every email, phone call, or conversation before, during, and after your actual interview date, so be your best self at all times.
- ### **Sending follow-up thank you notes**

Unless a school explicitly asks you _not_ to send thank you notes, you should send one to every single person who interviewed you, including current students, within 48 hours. Sending thank you notes by email is perfectly acceptable.
