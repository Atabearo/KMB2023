Strength:
- self-aware
	- cuts through the psychological barriers that protect us from the pain of failure or external disapproval
	- what I am, what I am not
	- mission-focused

Weakness:
- open to perspectives
	- strength is that you can get a wealth of information and 
	- take too long
	- sometimes clinical decisions 
	- as I gather experience and the expertise that comes with medical school, as well as become familiar with the context I practice under, I will be able to rely on my prior learning and intuition to make informed decisions 

What I will be able to bring to this school:
- my feedback
	- connecting to others
	- student feedback to grow
- understands the opportunities and challenges of being the inaugural cohort
	- participate in the generation of the school's culture, curriculum, and impression with clinical and non-clinical partners, like the Bentonville community.  Bring my particular passions and build up the school with my peers, faculty, and leaders
- understands that there will be challenges
	- no established norms. Establish relations between administration and students, faculty will be learning with us how to best deliver this new material in our AWSOM context.
		- (new projects) bring my resilience for undergoing the necessary conflict that comes with a newly established collaboration
		- Therein lies the opportunity to bring to light principles for effective communication and channels for feedback that benefit students, faculty, and admin, as well as the mission of the school
