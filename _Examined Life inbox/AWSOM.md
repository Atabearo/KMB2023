#### Leadership
##### Student Government
Serving in student government is an excellent opportunity to develop leadership skills, advocate for student needs, and collaborate with faculty and administration on initiatives that enhance student experience and success. Student government empowers students to represent their peers, voice concerns, shape the AWSOM experience

##### Committees
Students are expected to make recommendations based on their perspectives, as well as those of their peers. AWSOM offers medical students in good standing the opportunity to serve on the following committees: library, research, admissions, [curriculum](https://alwmedschool.org/education/curriculum/)

##### Student Interest Groups (SIGs, clubs)

#### Preparing for Step
"Starting in the first year, resource materials, education modules, practice tests, and facilitated small groups are offered to support the successful completion of Steps 1 and 2"

#### Holistic aspect
**Art of Healing**: "importance of effective advanced communication, observational and listening skills, ethics, professionalism, professional identity, and cultural aspects of healing. Students will learn about creative arts therapies and connect with the community through opportunities created by the School’s shared campus"

**Research:** "Students will learn the basic principles of research and evidence-based medical practice, including how to effectively locate, analyze, synthesize, and apply medical literature. In the process, they will be supported in developing the skills and practices needed to become life-long learners by fostering curiosity and inquiry. Students will design, implement, evaluate, and present a unique scholarly project. Scholarly endeavors will require them to define an area of need, reflect on how to meet that need, research the literature and existing resources, implement a potential solution, evaluate their project, and disseminate their findings. To support them in this activity, students will have access to mentors from a variety of research and clinical venues."

**Clinical**: (see above)

**Health Systems Science**: the systems thinking, "current health system structures, processes, and their impact, with a focus on developing skills to address them. This includes understanding social determinants of health, healthcare financing, policy, and errors, alongside systems-thinking and human-centered design competencies. Skills like motivational interviewing will be applied, and leadership will be practiced in interprofessional collaboration. Principles of public, community, and population health will also be integrated."

**Embracing Whole Health:** "Whole health principles and practices will be incorporated throughout the curriculum. Students will learn the fundamentals of whole-person care, taking the physical, behavioral, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects of a person’s life experience into account. Students will explore how self-care applies to their own lives and practice, and the importance of incorporating shared-care planning into clinical encounters. Self-care, effective teamwork, interprofessional collaboration, and patient empowerment will be key aspects of the whole health component of the curriculum. This element is intended to prepare students to become whole health advocates and leaders who can advance the principles of whole health throughout their future careers."
