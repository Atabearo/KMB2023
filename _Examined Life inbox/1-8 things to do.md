tell me about myself...

why medicine?
- starting with the story

I think its cool and I want to be a part of it



physicians 

the system isn't aligned 
I see that problem and I want to do something about it

leadership!
- too formal! (avoid "you" and say more "I" and "we")
- cut down the answer to focus more as the ME AS THE FOCAL POINT
- (and I am proud of the work)

SCRAP collective
- didn't

QUALITIES OF A GOOD PHYSICIANS
- don't let their qualities be a barrier to healthcare 
- and this is what I would want to practice and emphasize empathy as I practice and study medicine
