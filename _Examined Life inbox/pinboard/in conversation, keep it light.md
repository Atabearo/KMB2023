Especially in front of others, don't depreciate yourself.

1. You're better than that. You deserve at least to believe in yourself.
2. It's uncomfy for others
If you are going to express a comment regarding your own value: Even if it is true that you are not that great, it is better to add value to that expression with a joke (to show that you value the feelings of the other person, to put them at ease) or word it in a way that is not so plain and worrisome. (My unprocessed thoughts are between me and God, ONLY!)
