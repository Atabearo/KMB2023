### 2024 lesson
I remember 2024 being a year of struggle. Often, I felt like I was running in a circle, not improving, just getting by, spending the day coping and being unable/unmotivated to even move. I would work *so hard*, and what of it? If I needed to work hard to get "OK" or operate like a normal human, than stopping was not a choice. Keep swimming, or sink. 

Where have I ended up?
	Faith lays the foundation for my life once again (and hopefully this time, once and for all). In my friendships with others I have reclaimed my faith, and count among my blessings wonderful friends who inspire me to live. 
	I got over the extreme symptoms of my social anxiety. In exchange, I fell out of touch with a close friend for lots of time and brainspace to think about how I want to live. I am still scared, scared in moments that I am not enough and not decisive/driven enough to work hard, ultimately do good, or change.  
	Still. In the face of uncertainty in the world and in my decisions, I have learned that all I need do is keep still, and allow God to direct my life where He wills. I see a positive trajectory for myself, even if it isn't the most efficient. And ultimately, I rush headlong towards a good end. My ambitions for along the way are much simpler than they have been. I've always talked about wanting a large family and a career with great impact, but if I am not the Hero, then so be it. Even if my life appears to be a catastrophe, if I am in-step with the Lord then what else matters? The secret to joy in times of need and of abundance is trust -- and this year I have reconnected with a beloved friend and a very good God.
