11/11-12/27: [[Check-in - How do I want to live]]?



---

#### Check-ins:
mid-November ([[who I want to be... low stakes brainstorm]])
- I am doing these things! Being active, doing my work, being kind to myself, volunteering my words
Start of August ([[LT goals toward fall semester]]) to mid-October: 
	I want to become a doctor all the more, now in application season.
	I am becoming proud of who I am. I am not ashamed to be me.
	Other things I have tried:
	- signed up for PCT
	- tried CREW, decided not worth my commitment
	- my own exercising over rowing
