When I entered college, I wished to have a Socrates to examine life with. Now having my dear friends to accompany me, I wish to distill my thoughts to draw insights from my daily life into writing. This is to remember and reinforce my attention towards valuable and meaningful things: lessons, stories, and principles for how I want to live ([[giving from my heart]]).

I desire to live in a manner worthy of my calling and occupy myself with that which is worthy of my precious time on earth. Therefore I call upon the Spirit to guide my words and enkindle them in Love ([[lord, hear our prayer]]). AMDG.
