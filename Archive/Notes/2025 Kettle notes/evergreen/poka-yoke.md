> **Mistake-proofing**: *poka,* referring to "mistake, and *yoke*, meaning "avoid". 

Methodology developed by Shigeo Shingo to reduce human error. Accomplished by two means: 
- *mechanism*, which makes it impossible or "idiot-proof" to make an error, often through a force-stop. Examples: There is only one wat to plug in a three-pronged electrical cord. Microwaves will stop their process if the door is opened.
- *warning*, which indicates before a potential error is made. Examples: When you hit 'delete note', Obsidian asks if you are sure you want to delete note permanently. When routing to location that closes soon, Google Maps informs you with a pop-up to make sure you mean to go there.

Poka-yoke is a method for when the root cause of problems is simple human error. In implementation, the design should [[make it easy]] to do the right thing. The steps of poka-yoke:
1. [[identify problem]]
2. [[identify root causes]]
3. developing intervention:
	- determine poka-yoke *type* (mechanism or warning)
	- determine poka-yoke *method*
		1. Physical attribute (lock-and-key)
		2. Constant number (if number of actions=wrong then alert)
		3. Sequence (ordered process, like a checklist)
4. Implement and evaluate!
