The painful truth of our humanity is that nothing that we are or claim to be is our own ([[it's all cards]]). All pride in our own being and power is conceit, the work of our egos.

Recognition and acceptance of our "radical poverty", as St. Therese calls it, is how we cultivate humility ([[humility is sustaining the weight of truth]]). Humility is the attitude recognizing that all is a totally gratuitous gift of God's love and that we can attribute nothing to ourselves[^1].
