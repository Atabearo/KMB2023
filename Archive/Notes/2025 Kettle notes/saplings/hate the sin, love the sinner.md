I heard it recently said that to love truly unconditionally would be to "embrace it all", the sin, the sinner, their choices in total. I don't believe that to be fully loving. If in reality you truly [[get what you have chosen]], would it not be more loving to choose to care for the person and encourage them to choose that which brings them life?

There is [[no good sin]], and there is justice in opposing what is harmful to others. To love others we must embrace them and support treating them, individually and systematically, in a way that respects their human dignity.

We are all sinners ([[the human condition is wretched]]) and nothing that we have can be attributed to ourselves ([[humility is sustaining the weight of truth]]); so, we should love another even with another's propensity for falling. We do good to those who "don't deserve it" because that is our call to love. That is mercy.
