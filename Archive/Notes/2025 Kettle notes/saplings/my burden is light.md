>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light[^1].

In seeking God before any action, "[[just do it]]" isn't so much a sheer act of will but a receptivity, a simple "yes", to doing God's will. 

[^1]: Mt 11:28-30
