We talk about change often, and self-reflection on recent moral failures or concessions of values puts us in a spot that "pisses me off" or "makes me terribly depressed"[^1] ([[hate the sin, love the sinner]]). And all I do is cry and stew in my faults? Or bitch and complain on my weaknesses? Lots of anger involved.

While it feels like an awful spot to be in, the bitching and crying is definitely part of the process before we can reach the point of action phase ([[just do it]]). And even with the temporary hopelessness, it is not forever ([[optimism]]).
