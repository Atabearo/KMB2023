> The people who interest me are either like the sun or a ray of sunshine. Rays of sunshine are kind, warm to be around and give off a presence that is like light. Maybe a bit goofy, make you laugh. When I say someone is a sun, they have a pressure. Something in them that draws you in, that pulls you in their orbit. And they are not necessarily warm and bubbly and give off kindness. They can be intimidating.

The people who I find I am drawn to also have a presence. While kindness is certainly a feature of people that I gravitate towards, the quality in others that inspires me to live is passion and drive to create, I love seeing that kind of pressure within others.

Can you see the light in others? How much brighter is [[the source, the root, the ocean]], very *light* itself.
