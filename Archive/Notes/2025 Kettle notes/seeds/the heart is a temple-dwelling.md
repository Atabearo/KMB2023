[[where God is present, he is hidden]]

When it is said God dwells in our hearts, he makes a dwelling OF our heart. To have Him there is to [[welcome God's presence]]]].

>"the main point is that we must be absolutely determined to give it to Him, and that we clear it out so that he can put things in and take things out, as in a house of his own." ([[grace transforms]]) "That is the condition he lays down, and His Majesty is right; let us not refuse him." 
>(Way of Perfection, 2.8)

If I knew He was always there, I wouldn't' have left Him alone so often. I would have tried to make it less dirty.
