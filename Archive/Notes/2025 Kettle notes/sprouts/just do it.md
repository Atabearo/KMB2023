The grind refers to the daily activities necessary to achieve your goals. "Want a wife? Look for people. Be aware. Improve your hygiene. Build your self-confidence. A doctor? Hit the books. Write and reflect on purpose. Volunteer. Practice."

###### Other things to remember when you just got to do it:
1. Having a clear vision on [[a foundationally good reality]] will help one "map out the terrain" and live accordingly.
2. You are not alone in this fight ([[my burden is light]]); in your corner there is one who fights for you, [[who calls you by name]]. He is [[the source, the root, the ocean]] of life, energy, vitality itself. To be sure, you will have exactly what you need for the moment ([[providence in abundance]]) if you ask for it.
