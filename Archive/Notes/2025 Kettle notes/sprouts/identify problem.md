The most important step in problem-solving. Think about a doctor's work: if you misdiagnose a patient, they will have to undergo various ineffective treatment and their side effects before seeing the doctor again to find what is actually wrong with them. Time, resources, and pain could have been saved otherwise, had the problem been identified correctly.

Appreciable for his scientific approach: documented and [[evidence-based]]!
