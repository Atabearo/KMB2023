Essential ingredients for disease: a *host*, an *agent*, and an *environment*.
### Who studies disease?
In the EH framework:
- The epis study human health conditions,
- Agents are studied in a lab,
- EH study the environment
	- for purpose of understanding human health ([[environmental health is primarily concerned with humans]])

#### The What:
##### Agents
often include radiation, heavy metals, invertebrates (pests!), pathogens (microorganisms), or synthetic chemicals ([[pesticides]]).
#### The How:
##### [[exposure]] in ENV
for chemicals: the magnitude, duration, and frequency with
which organisms interact with biologically available toxicants.
##### [[exposure routes]] to hosts
are dietary (from food or water), dermal (by skin), injection (through skin), or inhalational (from air).
