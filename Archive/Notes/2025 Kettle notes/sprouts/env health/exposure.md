the *magnitude, duration* and *frequency* with which an organism interacts with *biologically available* toxins ([[toxicity]]).

for an [[exposure assessment]][^1]:
- source characterization (how much? where to?)
- fate and transport modeling (how far> how fast? how long? where to?)
	- In HMS C8 study, there was a lot of PFOAs found upstream of the DuPont plant--why? because transport pathways transport to thru the water and air
- exposure modeling (inhalation? ingestion?)
- pharmacokinetic modeling (how much remains in the body after metabolization, excretion, exhalation?)
- epidemiologic analysis (is it linked to disease?)
