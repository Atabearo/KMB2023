The optimism I speak of here is knowing in your bones that the external depths and one's personal stumblings of the present are not the end of the story. No timeline, no specific victories or events can be assured to the future or attached to this belief; this optimism lives in the present.

With this kind of belief, the present sufferings do not take the lionshare of the narrative. One can dare to dream greatly. Only with optimism could you not only dare to be great, but believe that it is in your future reality to become great ("a noble vision, but one in your power to achieve").
