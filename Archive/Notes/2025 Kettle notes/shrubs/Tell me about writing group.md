This question spurs out of the depths of gratitude of my heart. "[[Tell me about the thing you love most]]", and it is to share life with others. I love accompaniment. All my closest friends are just *nerds*, and even in college all I wanted to do was to throw them all in a room so we could share good things, good food, and good memories together. This I have wished in birthday messages, but to have it all in a community space warms my very soul. For a dear girl who is scared of group chats and suffers depersonalization from socializing with her classmates, I'm so grateful that we have carved out a digital space for her and for all of us to be ourselves. It's really a beautiful thing. If I spend 6 hours a day on my laptop and even more reading/writing alone, how much better is it that I get to do so with some of my favorite people in the world?

Unintended consequences of writing group:
- lots of like minds getting to know each other, community building
- connection of similar interests (health, public health, person-centered care, and God)
- finding out that one of the greatest things I did for Ethan was showing him the "high road", and showing him what Christianity was all about over enchiladas
- unexpected hype sessions on the effect I have on my friends (I am flustered yes and ask God for humility in this) 
	- finding out that one of the gifts God has granted me is joy regardless of my circumstance ("you don't have to be happy all the time, and who you are in an environment does not depend on your environment")
	- like how Mattie expresses it, I have that inspiring effect
- That I have very little composure when it comes to "that others see my work that doesn't represent totally what I am about"
	- may have unintentionally created a space for sharing work that needed to be written at that moment
- Process feelings of transition and the feelings of the moment
- Invite Mattie into my journaling time
- Figure out that my "dead horse social anxiety guilt complex" was truly, "the inherent shame of being" in a social space and feeling like a failure
