"What's new under the sun?" I sometimes get down in the face of brokenness, both in the world and within myself. I wonder the extent to which that assertion is true: that there is nothing new under the sun, that all of humanity has been broken in the same ways and we have the same problems in new skins. That more people are literate now than in the past means that more individuals are free to extend their personal capacities. Because, back then, the illiterate would largely have to trust that the one with the power to read is using his authority justly. Are we more upright now than back then? The inclination in our human condition is the same: whether its people acting on their own rationale, or following in the leadership of another person, there has always been a drive in humans to turn inwards or for destruction. 
So it seems that the unprecedented troubles of our times are fundamentally the same as the ones of old; only our tools change. Technology increases the scale and impact for our choices, even to our collective extinction.

The number of elderly I saw at a rally exactly last week was staggering. Lots of veterans. One even brought his oxygen tank to show up. Talking to them, I felt a pang of their anguish. Could you imagine taking to the streets back in the 60s for an end to oppression and a future without war and living to see the backslide? Less than an hour ago, the U.S. entered into war. The world is so interconnected that the sufferings of one region would surely be felt all over the earth. It would be folly to place hope in human progress. 
The war creates no new situation, only aggravating the permanent human condition to the point we can no longer ignore it. It becomes clear in crisis that life is fragile and, inevitably, the same end comes to the wise and to the fool on earth. Any hope centered in this world was always doomed to frustration. 
So where does that leave us? A man claiming to be God professed a loving Father and a ministry of love to follow. He promised to be with his people always, until the time for restoration of all things. He died, and people from his day to now testify that this man, Jesus, is a living God. If he is who he said he was, then he has always been the only hope for mankind. No other in human history has offered a reason to hope for the human condition, otherwise.

There would be suffering in this world
"All schemes of happiness that centre in this world, were always doomed to a final frustration."

If not a worldwide armed conflict, 30 years of poor stewardship getting poorer will create an inhospitable environment for us and an uninhabitable one for our grandchildren.  

There appears to be injustice that many would have to suffer for the actions of a few, but this is is the consequence of human organization. This is why it is true that great power comes with great responsibility. 

We are broken in different ways, so who can condemn another person? God have mercy on us. I am only who I am by circumstance, my life and gifts given to me. If I had your cards, it could have been me who had fallen the way you had.


I hear people hearken back to the good old days. ("It is not from wisdom that you ask this." Eccl 7:10) Do you know, the discourse around those who are upset at the rights women do have, and in part blame the culture enabling women for the high rate of divorce, declining birth rates, and that there are so few good women?  There have always been the drive to enjoy power over others, and historically men enforced this in the family by physical force, social convention, legal rules and justifying their actions by law, nature, or religion. Married women were once legally subordinate to their husbands in the U.S., and considered under ownership then. "Men and women were happier with traditional families." That's natural. That's God's way: for women to "endure to the end". NO--rather, it is far more unnatural to force the "traditional family", which has only existed its current form for 200 years. It takes a village to raise a family; you constrain two people to do the work of 20 people, and you wonder why parents are so strained. Insanity! Fellas, did liberals ruin women, or is it just that women are deciding they don't want to date a man who votes for laws that don't take away their rights, terrorize others, and profit off suffering? You want American women to have more babies? Try maternal leave, subsidized childcare, healthcare and education for the kids, why not make an environment that women would want to have kids in?

> "Women are taught that their only hope of heaven, is to "endure to the end," That it is a religious duty to "submit themselves to their husbands in all things," I know a man who tells his wife "I own you, I have got a deed (marriage license and certificate) to you and got it recorded, I have a right to do what I please to you," And the law of a Christian land says she shall submit, to indecencies that would make a respectable devil blush for shame."
