My good and faithful friend, my BBB4Lyfe, bestie. In college and in Houston, I can say she is someone who I enjoy the mere company of in extreme amounts. The practical and rational one who has a good understanding of the personal value/worth (similar to [[MiVi]]). Spontaneous to a degree some may call a fault, but do we regret the time and money we sunk into the things we love? "Disappointed, but not surprised" by our behavior.

Who I would call...
- to eat a fire goat birria
- to go on a 4 hour adventure with
	- such as hunting elves/unicorns/Easter eggs at World Market
- when I "inevitably" quit medicine and want to open a taco truck or bakery (tbh I would also recruit [[Isabel]] for our venture too)
- for my [[emotional support advisory board]], before making a big decision (and getting scammed) or in a big situation (getting bumped by another car)
