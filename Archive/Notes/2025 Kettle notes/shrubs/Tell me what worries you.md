Job, that I won't get one "good enough" for me

That I won't be able to help my aging parents

It'll be OK. God truly, really does got it, and He knows. And He loves you, and He's proud of you. And your parents would not be disappointed even if you did settle for a public health job. Keep doing what you're doing. We will figure it out--and you are not alone in this.
