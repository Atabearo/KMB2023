Simply put, do whatever you need to do to keep going forward. Once you are able to function, you can do the things you are obligated to do.

You can rest. You can feel things through. Remember you are strong enough to get back up.

### THINGS THAT WORKED:
1.  If I want to be "more functional", *get moving*. Get out of your paralysis holes and lying in bed. The answer sometimes, I intuit, may be to get more out of my head
	*Evidence*: Once I went to Mass and studied and hung out and did my day, I was happier! I might need to just leave the house, actually
		DOING AND REFLECTING:
			Doing is good, being busy with *things that you like* is a GOOD THING
			Reflecting is also good, its purpose is to live BETTER, and focus on MEANINGFUL THINGS, and cultivate DEEPER DOING
2. Another way to "get more out of my head", *talk to another human being*
	*Evidence:* Trisha called to talk to me and shared about her life. I even got to share about how I was "bear minimum" without feeling bad about it.
		Sometimes all we need is to think of more in the world. The sadness felt so encompassing, and even hearing Trisha talk about her day made me remember that we appreciate life and connection even as we are sad.
3. Sometimes you just need to *rest*.
	*Evidence:* I just put my head down to sleep, and that was pretty nice. I woke up feeling clear-headed and ready for action.
