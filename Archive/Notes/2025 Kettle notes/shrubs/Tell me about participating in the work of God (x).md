Christ's whole life was a mission to reunite God and His people. In His conception and birth, he reconciled Man to God by taking on flesh. His hidden, working life, all He did was in obedience to His parents and to God's will. In His ministry, He revealed who He was and the loving heart of the Father. He established a New Jerusalem on a solid foundation and took up a Cross, dying, to show His Love for us. He gave us His Blessed Mother. In rising, He showed that He was who He said He was: a true King, the fulfillment of the Old Covenant, a testament to God's faithfulness to us. Through Christ we know we have a loving Dad; Him, a risen Lord; and the Spirit which He sent to us. We have His Church that He established and its living ministry. Through the Church that He promised to safeguard, we have Sacred Scripture (the Word of God!) and Sacred Tradition. We have the Sacraments that He instituted and our apostolic successors. 

This is all God has given to us with our mission. I think it is the great folly of Christians that we forget that our mission is to live like Christ. I heard this analogy once:

> Could you imagine growing up with a dad who taught you how to be a good man, to be faithful and kind, diligent and loving. He dies, and *all* you do is talk about what a great guy he was? Yes! It's true, the "and also" is that you have to follow his example and continue his work. There's a call to action involved.

To be a child of God and a friend of Christ, we are called to love like God does.
