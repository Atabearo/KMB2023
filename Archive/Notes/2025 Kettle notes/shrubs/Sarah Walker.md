> *For safety, for fun, for law!*
> - what Sarah says after she double checks if [[Hamzah]] is buckled into the Expedition

A 30y/o solo traveler by the time I met her. She is fluent in Spanish and has worked in Madrid and international community development around Latin America, Africa, and Europe. A fellow runner, grew up in the natural scenes with her beloved sister! Is visiting the Midwest-y area for her sister's graduation. She is very open about who she is and is now herself looking for community in Waco for the time being, loves her work and relates also to people a decade older and younger than she is. She is a "calls please" type of person and sends postcards. 

Rebooted BearAid last year and has been working with [[Hamzah]] and then [[Ernesto]], [[Jaxon]], and [[Shelby]] since.
