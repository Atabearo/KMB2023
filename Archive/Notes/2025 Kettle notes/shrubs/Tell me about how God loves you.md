I feel that I need so much to be happy: if I can just get focused, get my day structured, or if I finished my dang applications, then I would have the space to engage the people around me and the greater world. This is what I tell myself, and what's left in the present is just that need.  When I take a walk outside, I hear a voice outside myself that it is all vapor. "What is new under the sun?" I ask, will this *really* make me happy? At times like these, I begin to question if I want anything at all, even to live. If it weren't for the people around me or God Himself, I would get lots in myself and my need.
I feel like I am not enough to have the happiness that others have. Am I especially weak-willed? I cannot say, but rather than asking *am I enough for happiness?*, perhaps I should be asking if happiness is the goal at all. Rather than questioning whether I am qualified or not, I think the greater problem is that I am afraid I am *weak*. But for God, I don't need to be strong.

To answer your question, how does God love me?
It is perhaps that He is all that there is that matters. That behind all of the toil, and the works of others, and wanting to do this and that and solve these problems and the work itself! None of it matters. But here is a God who knows my character weakness, my earthly desires for a spouse and for community, and just how distracted I can get. He knows I want worthwhile work.

He loves me in the way that I get up every morning and greets me like a dad: here is what we are going to do today. Ask me if you need anything. I'm here with you.
You know, my brother left today. "It's so boring to drive up by myself." "We won't really get to hang out" but you know, I would have been happy just to be there with him even at the end of our days.
God loves me by his very presence. There is the a risk of being excessively burdened by work, but less have I considered the joy behind the work, too. How wonderful it is to serve my Lord.

10 min rewrite:

**The work that matters.**
Blame my scattered brain, blame my smartphone addiction, maybe it's how summers have always gone: when I lose my day's structure, I become very troubled with how to spend my days. I want to do something worthwhile, and suddenly it appears to me that nothing seems to be worth it. Do you remember in the pandemic, when more people started spending more time at home, wondering what to do? I draw inwards. I have less to say to others, I lie still and do nothing, and life--work, play, reaching out, learning more, all of it!-- feels meaningless. "What's new under the sun?" It goes round and round, with or without me. In the course of the Earth, of course, it appears true that nothing I do matters. But does the same apply in the course of my own life? Forget an impactful career, what say even a working routine for myself! Even if I did work to build up that for myself, would I be happy?

A wise man once said that all of the activities of the earth is like vapor ("vanities of vanities, all is vanity!"). And in the sense of the world, that's true: nothing matters, if this world is all there is. If, though, there is a life after this where our actions today count, then it all matters.

There is much more I would want to say on participating in the work of God. At least, I want to describe the picture of it that gives me daily hope.

[[Tell me more about the presence of God]]. This is a heartfelt piece on feeling lost and weak, and how God chooses you anyway. He asks for mutual participation, to allow His presence in your life and to be present in His. 
[[Tell me again how God loves you.]] We have identified way #1: **God loves me by inviting me to participate in His work.** [[Tell me about participating in the work of God (x)]].
