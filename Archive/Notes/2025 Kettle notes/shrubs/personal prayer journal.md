Beloved friend,

If I were to measure my gratitude in proportion to the impossibility of something existing, then I would have to thank you immensely for each and every one of my friends. I'm thankful for To and that very thankful for writing group. Gratitude goes out for knowing someone who so heartfelt and just so cool? I admire him a lot.

And I just ran into Arlene right now! It's so good to be here. 

Lord, I keep thinking about that night where I just felt so weak and broken. Sometimes I think about my approach to life and how it has changed me over time--have I become less of a planner/dreamer, lost a bit of ground on my "internal locus of control" because of my worldview and experiences? Reason tells me that I haven't stopped trying to grow and make good decisions within my control. Underneath that though, I know it is good to stay close to you regardless of my traits that may have changed. 
I don't want to offend you Lord, and I learn every day. (I learn every day, I say, as if to tell you not to give up on me.) But you, Lord, know this and know me well. And you are always the one pursuing me.
It seems I rely on others pursuing me, more than I seek to be there for others. I am grateful for this, too. But Lord, I want to be able to be there for others like you show up for us!

To speak and carry the presence of God. Lord, I ask you for the strength to learn and do this well.

I want to suffer more gracefully--I know the old and the sick and the young and the healthy, we all suffer. So if I can help others to suffer with grace, that would be a very good thing. I know I am the most weak and miserable, but I know your grace is for us for that reason. 

Much love,
Jaime

Identity has been the theme of today and how it may either restrict or revive a person.
I asked for the Lord's help in the thing that gives me misery and worry, and here He is to say that he claims me and I only need to say what He says I shall say. 
Even at the end of day, I watch a story of how an identity consumed by shame limits and destroys itself (it's K-Pop Demon Hunters).

*Is something in the way (between you and God)? Can you move it?* (Q&A June 12)

What is going well? I listen to your word most every day Lord, and I pray to stay on mission and am mindful of your precepts. I feel more assured in talking about you freely. I know you. And I know you know me. I know that I am weak, and I call on you to be present with me and work in me. What else would you like me to do? How do I love you more?

Can you move me, Lord? Keep on going. And keep reading.

	Beloved friend,
	A spontaneous prayer for this moment. If writing is how I make sense of the world, I suppose writing with you would be another way to see you in my day and perceive you in the world. If 40% of my life is written and remembered, 10% is remembered unrecorded, I figure 100% is remembered in my bones and lived by me and lived with you. 
	Do you know why I hesitate to reach out to To? I feel the disturbance is in me and I'm trying to untangle it here, with you. I am really grateful to have met him, and as it is, it was and is a valuable relationship to me no matter how I handle it. I know you put him in my life. But what is Your will for me from here? Back on graduation, I believe I was discerning correctly when Mattie said "Today is the day!" And it was. And it was good. Is today the day, Lord? 
	I see that nothing matters but to obey you, my Lord. The effects, the impact, the events of this world all come to nothing. But to love you and to love others? That is all the work that matters in my life. 
	*I ask that I may do whatever you ask, Lord, and to trust you. You tell me, "peace", and that it will be OK. Help me to take this peace into my heart and let it live there.*
