"It would just be so boring to drive up by myself." My brother left this past weekend to go back to school. I noticed he doesn't so much ask as he does suggest that I go back to UIUC with him. Even then he set his expectations: "you know, even if you did go with, we wouldn't really get to hang out." He has research and work, every day. The last weekend I went, he left before 7am and came back at 6. We ate, hung around, and went to sleep. Even so, it was a pleasure to know we would have that time and be in the same place. It was good to share bread and a meal. It was OK that we didn't hang out-- dare I say it was very good. I can only imagine if it were me who had to go back to an empty apartment AND do the work he does, I would find a lot of peace in company, too.

I cannot overstate how much I love having company and accompanying others. It's like doing the things I regularly enjoy: eat, be active, do work, pray, enjoy media, appreciate the world. But what if it was a potluck? Or a running crew? Accountability silent study. Watch party. Tea time. Even sharing a thing through text, the accompaniment is implicit. (You may enjoy seeing that I made) miso soy sauce overnight oats. (This reel made me think of you.) I applied for this job today (and I thought you would like to know). Doing all of these things, doing life in community that cares for another? That's the best thing.
