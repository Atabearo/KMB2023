Depict the memories of our friendship. Looking back at the people we once were, who seem to be looking to where we are now. 

--- 

Speak, memory:

Chance and probability
Beauty wonder and curiosity
Love
Strength and growth
Finest hour

Looking back on our times 
Not yet
From where we are

Promise time, promise time

Stars
Suns and rays and glowy marshmallows
Stars as windows to our storied past
