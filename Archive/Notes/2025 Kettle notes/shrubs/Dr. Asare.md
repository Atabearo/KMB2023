Our interactions have consisted of student-teacher, but has grown through our chance encounters all over campus. He is someone who cares about bringing people up, especially those who need it most, as someone himself was brought up by a mentor. By chance, he gave me really fire advice on how to go forward in the professional future with rejection ([[rejection is God's protection]]) and going forward, doing my part and having faith. "Doing my part" in this instance, is approaching opportunities with confidence and intent to go in. "Life is unpredictable, and if they wanted to fire you the next day and not tell you why, they would." So don't feel obliged to tell them they are the backup plan.
