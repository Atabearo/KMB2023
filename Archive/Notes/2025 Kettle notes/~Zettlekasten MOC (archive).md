## Step 1. **Ctrl-W** for a thought dump or draw from TempNote
- if there is anything you want to remember for [[Contact Book]], do so
### Key
- *seeds*: ideas not in a MOC yet
- *sprouts*: notes that found a space in the MOC
- *saplings*: well-integrated into the forest (other notes), not yet a full-fledged note
- *evergreen*: stand-alone tree, could stand to be published without major revisions
- *shrubs*: indicator lists, person notes, stories, the type of note that grows as needed. Can stand to be augmented or pruned, but need not work done to them
## Step 2.  Turn fleeting thought seeds into content saplings and link them to a collection below. 
### Note: 
If it is to **broken down** into atoms and remembered in piecemeal, it belongs in the **Kettle**. 
If it is better consumed as a **whole**, such as a narrative or timeline, it belongs in **Journals**.
