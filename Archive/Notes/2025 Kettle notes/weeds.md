- being OK with your weaknesses
	what are you anxious and insecure about?
	- lacking confidence
		- awkward in speech (but people like you anyway)

		- too afraid to take risk and "be myself" 
		- not knowing what I want
		- easily overwhelmed

THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN ACTIVELY "DOING SOMETHING":
- think about "intent"
- seek opportunity
- execute, be kind with yourself, and learn

WHEN "DOING SOMETHING" GOES WRONG:
1. you learned something. Next time, you can do better.
2. the other person won't care if you "do something wrong" or you "don't do anything" at all. Better to *learn*.
3. You tried, which is *courageous*.
	You regret the things you don't do more than the things you do.
