# What do you want to remember from Texas Tour, Durango addendum?

I thought about the world turning, turning, turning, even as I departed from my friends in their places. A few tears escaped me on the flight to Chicago.

*Houston

Sunday, I ran until I almost threw up. We eat tacos. I got banned from singing in his car, so-called rage baiting. He talked me through his favorite Spanish songs, introduced me to Chente music. 
Monday, I dropped him off at work. We ran 4 laps around a park, until he felt so bad for me at the 8th mile that he called it quits (I refuse to say I lost). We feasted on wings, cake and ice cream from HEB over My Hero Academia.
Tuesday, he woke me up at 7am to watch one more episode before work (with an amused, I felt bad about waking you up but I remembered you were unemployed). I told the truth in saying that this was the most fun I had on my Texas Tour. 

Wednesday, he told me, as he drove me to the airport, he should have let me take the Uber. 

I think I have no other friend who is more boundary pushing and is comfortable with expressing his negative emotions. Anyone else would have kept that irritation to themself! 
As well, I didn't know he was accommodating me until the end of the trip; he gave up junky food but ate it because I was around. He was also in his sleep by 8, wake at 5 to hit the gym. Not when I was there; we regularly woke around 7am and hung out until the end of day. We didn't even hit the gym. He dissuaded me from running after I threw up, but let me run the 8th mile because I felt up to it. 

I wonder [[what it would take to be brave]].
