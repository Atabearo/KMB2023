A loose formula for spiritual reading from *Fr. Mike Gaitley, MIC:*[^1]
	Pause
	Reflect
	Speak
	Now Listen

Basically, a formula to not just read, but to have a conversation with Jesus while reading and allow God to inspire you. Reading this way is an opportunity to notice the enkindling desire and love inspired, and to bring those desires to God. Ask the Lord; He will speak.
