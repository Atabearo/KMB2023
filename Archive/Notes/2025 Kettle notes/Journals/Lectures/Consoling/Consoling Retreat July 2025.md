### Principle and Foundation
What do you intend to do here?
	Lord, I intend to be a saint. Increase my yearning, help me to burn for love of you. 

The mission: Jesus intends to bring *everyone* back home to his Father. 
	My human family. Family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten.
	I need Him, that's obvious. It is also true that He needs me in His mission: to be His hands, feet, words and actions on earth. To save, heal, and console others. Here and now.
		***No,*** I fear I am wrong. He *thirsts* for my love. He needs me.

I fall into sorrow when I contemplate the tragedies for the world
	But I lost the plot, I forget my mission when I discard the need for change
	Jesus sees humanity's pain constantly, detailed, and it breaks his Heart. 

The **Sacred and Eucharistic Heart of Jesus**
	The Scared Heart and the Eucharistic Heart (the "source and summit of the Christian life") are one in the same
	What do I say to my beloved friend when he says to me, *"Behold this Heart which loves so much yet is so little loved"*?
		Jesus himself is in need of help and consolation. This is a man with feelings, who is hurt when people are cold, ungrateful, and afraid of him.
		"Jesus, I must help you"
		I intend to be your true friend. "What can I give to you?"

The process of purifying a heart
	A complex and complicated person is one with all kinds of desires
	A simple person is having but one desire. Jesus has a desire best described as a thirst, a thirst that all humanity be brought into his communion of love with the Father and the Holy Spirit (Jn 17:24)
	*Do you see how utterly simple the Lord is?*
	 His love is rejected and not satisfied, so he is a simple and sorrowful man (Ps 69:21)
	 **The Principle and Foundation:** to console a Heart. "Here I am, Lord. I come to console you."

Consolation for Christ
	The world is grieving and broken. Its members, the members of the Body of Christ, are suffering.
		We console Jesus when we alleviate the suffering of the poor, the sick, the lonely, for they truly are Christ to us. "Whatsover you do..." (Mt 25:40)
	The Head of the Mystical Body: Jesus himself
		"The loving consolation was received by our Lord... in his *nunc stans*, everlasting now. This is the great truth which many artists have sought to communicate through the ages by painting various saints from different time periods standing at the foot of the cross. Although separated by time, their great love for Christ did in fact console him in his agony, since our Lord foresaw all their acts of loving consolation." (Timothy O'Donnell, STD, theologian of the Sacred Heart)
		Christ the man still possesses human emotional states, though now in a risen manner. "Being in communion with the members of his body, who are not risen, their experiences are his experiences. The manner in which he, as risen, experiences these 'un-risen' experiences of his earthly body, I do not know" (p 54, Fr. Thomas Weinandy, OFM)
		Origen of Alexandria (185-254), "My Savior grieves even now about my sins..."
			*'With you,'* he says, *'I will drink in the Kingdom of my Father'* (Mt 26:29)
			"The Apostles too have not yet received their joy...They cannot know perfect joy as long as they grieve over our transgressions and weep for our sins"
			"You too will wait, just as you are awaited"
			It really is like a family dinner; we won't enjoy eating all together until the whole family is here.
	"*I thirst*" is Jesus' in his need for us, for our love. *That* is a testimony of love.
		Christ humbled himself and accepted to feel a burning thirst ("need") for our love, so that we might enter into a genuine friendship with him.
		JPII calls it God's great mercies to us that in Christ Jesus, he allows himself to be in need of mercy from us.
			JPII: "I am convinced that the *objective starting point of love is the realization that I am needed by another*. The person who objectively needs me most is also, for me, *objectively*, the person I most need. This is a fragment of life's deep logic." (emphasis in original)
### Obstacles to Living the Foundation
#### Fear of suffering: nothing to fear
- eyes not on the goal (first thing) but the means (second thing), and then tried to attain that means by his own willpower
"Walk *with* me." "All I want is for you to be my friend. All I want is for you to not be afraid of me and to come to me. That's all."
	A simple man.
	Lord, I hear you. And as you know, I want to be your friend. And I am willing to suffer for your sake, and I know you are with me to bear the sufferings you have allowed for my participation for your mission and to love you. Even if I temporarily lose sight of you and put my eyes a little too far past you or too near within myself, I don't think I could ever abandon you again.
		I can see why you wanted me to come here first before I reached out to my brother, my friend. The same things I do to you, in a less dire fashion, I do to my friend on earth. I become fearful of him and hold the false Jansen-ist belief that I am not good enough to approach him. He's not as simple as you, but I know all he wants from me is that I be his friend. He's a gentle and patient man. I don't wish to cause either of you grief, I intend to grieve you no more. 
		When I approach without the intent to love (you, or him), then I stumble and am consumed by harmful shame. I lose sight. Lord, help me to see you clearly and to focus on you, first.
- suffering doesn't frighten me so much as it discourages me (fear of weakness)
	When I am discouraged by suffering, only then does it obscure my view of Jesus.
	But the crosses Jesus chooses for me are sufficient, and he is incredibly gentle. He knows what I can take and what I need. He's gentler than I am with myself.
	Lord, I remember walking with you through your Passion earlier this year. That what is an "amazing deal" for me does come at a cost to someone--in that you face our collective ingratitude and barbs in exchange for your most compassionate, gentle, thirsting Heart.
		I know that when you walk with me through the darkness, that you comfort me. I didn't realize that walking with you was a comfort to you, too, in your darkest days. 
		Take my hand, please keep your eyes on me, I say. Take my hand, please keep your eyes on me, you say on the road to Calvary, a suffering Heart of your own.
	When I am overwhelmed with my own suffering or the suffering of the world (the second thing), I have forgotten the suffering of my Lord (the first thing).
		A shift in focus
	The Lord simply wants me as his companion. He asks from me great love, not immense strength or suffering. Do you see how tremendously valuable it is to simply be there with him? 
- our personal sufferings have their own place. Small personal suffering combined with the offering of Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross + interceding with bold confidence = incredibly powerful prayers
	Sometimes our prayers are timid because we know that they come at the price of sacrifice.
		Therefore, since our suffering/willingness to sacrifice may be small === we don't ask for huge graces
		=== Afraid of the cost of asking huge grace
		Who are we fooling? We can merit nothing on our own
		BUT if we, with confident love, unite our own little suffering to Jesus' Passion, they take on *infinite merit*.
			THEREFORE, let us boldly ask for conversions, graces, and all that is truly good, knowing that such prayers bring great delight to the Lord
- "school of love"
	- Jesus wants to gently leads us through the grades, as he gently led Faystina to graduate
		Faustina would admit to remaining little in all the grades through which Jesus carried her
		First grade (school of the Cross)
	- Keep your eyes on our teacher, and he will carry us along the way. That is how little ones progress.
- suffering, with Jesus, can become sweet and take on great value
	- offer our own little sufferings (and they are all little compared to the Lord's)
		- joy of knowing that we console his Heart
		- further, uniting these to those of Jesus, grace and mercy is poured out on others
- redemptive suffering (Col 1:24)
	- Objectively, Jesus' suffering is objectively enough to save everyone, and the graces his suffering merits are availed to all
	- The "lack" in Christ's suffering is in the sense that not everyone subjectively accepts his grace and mercy
		- or *fully* accept his grace and mercy (halfheartedly, with reservations/conditions)
		- then it is our place for our sufferings and bold prayers
			Free will
		- God will not (and cannot) force us to choose him and love him
		- Yet when we use our free will on behalf of others, we somehow can influence the free will of those other people
			- Our prayers and little sufferings do have great power to move souls, so let's not waste them
#### Fear of weakness
##### The Little Way
- I wonder why my weaknesses get me so down. I think it is in as much as I want to live a vibrant faithful life (for others to see?), that I get down that I am so weak. My sufferings appear large. The suffering of the world, I feel the hardness of it all, but without the strength of God with me. I lose sight because I focus on the means rather than the goal.
- God inspires us both.
	- St. Therese, thank you for your loving God in that you embraced your littleness and His arms for the world, and for little souls like me. 
		- She wrote her sister Marie a story to explain the Little Way, about a little bird with broken wings.
		- I'm only now coming back to terms with my weakness in writing, does it not feel like you will never be able to fly, to soar on the heights of love? 
		- My wings are broken! How can I hope to do anything to move the world like God does, how can I possibly become the holy person God calls?
			- In so I neglect my treasure, and forget the Heart of Jesus: he's not asking me to move the world, he's only asking that I be with him, to be his friend. He's only asking that I try. Even if I don't feel like I am making progress, I know that he moves me. 
		- How incredible the compassion that compels Jesus' Heart to lift the little ones.
- Love of our weakness
	Do not look at the rough stairway of perfection and deem it impossible to reach the heights of holiness. Do not let your holy desires cool to ash.
	Our weakness is the ticket to the elevator, the little way to holiness
		The elevator is Mercy.
		Mercy has two parts:
			Heart: comes first, begins with the heart's movement, compassion for the one who suffers. Then overflows into the movement of the--
			Arms: that reach out to help alleviate the suffering of the other
		St. Therese taught of one specific suffering that moved the Lord's Heart more than any other: compassion for the little souls stuck at the bottom of the rough stairway, breaking further for those souls falling into pits of discouragement, despondency, even despair. 
			Arms reach down to embrace such little souls and carry them to the heights of holiness, as he taught to St. Therese
	The Little Way: Ticket to Ride
		How to enter elevator? To continually trying to climb the stairway of perfection, by continually to *try* to grow in virtue and holiness
			Different attitude to try not to be discouraged. Peacefully keep trying, knowing that Jesus comes down, lifts us up, and eventually carries us to the heights
				We might not see him doing it, but he does. We might not feel like we're going anywhere, but we are. We might not think anything has changed, but it has.
		A strange way of holiness that doesn't seem to work. In other words, the little souls in the elevator often look no different than other souls
			Vices, struggles, imperfections just like everyone else
			But that is part of the Lord's strategy as he works in little souls: He likes to keep them little.
				**So as to give them the biggest gift of Himself, for those who accept the lowest places here on earth**
					If they were bounding, they would not be so little === not move his Heart as deeply
					Big souls who don't feel the need to rely completely on Jesus for everything === not reach those highest heights
			Yet little souls going the Little Way are different in that they are big on the virtue of *trust*
				Trust in the mercy of God, trust that God does not put unrealizable desires in my heart, trust his promise that he'll satisfy my desires for holiness, even if it seems impossible. Trust in the merciful Heart of Jesus that, I know, cannot resist humble confidence
	- My virtues, talents, gifts *are nothing*... "what pleases Him is that *He see me loving my littleness and my poverty, the blind hope I have in His mercy*... That is my only treasure"
		- To consent to remain small and love our smallness is to be poor in spirit, to full send God's mercy
		- "The weaker one is, the more suited one is for the workings of this consuming and transforming Love ... But we must consent to remain always poor and without strength and this is the difficulty... Let us love to feel nothing, then we shall be poor in spirit, and Jesus will come look for us [and] He will transform us in flames of Love". 
			- "Power made perfect in weakness".
- On weakness as a ticket to holiness
	1. To accept and even love our weaknesses
	2. Persist efforts to grow even as you fail
	3. Look up at Jesus' merciful Heart with great confidence
- then we can be assured that the arms of his Heart will carry us there
##### Barriers
###### Sinfulness
Little Way attitude of humble confidence
- two daughters cause offense to loving father. Later when they hear his footsteps, one of them runs off and hides while the other runs to her father, jumps in his arms, and confesses her offense to him. 
	- The father loves them both, both one has broken his heart while the other has consoled it.
	- "Even though I had on my conscience all the sins that can be committed, I would go, my heart broken with sorrow, and throw myself into Jesus' arms, for I know how much He loves the prodigal child who returns to Him"
- "When you give me your sins, you give me the joy of being your Savior". Jesus ardently desires to forgive us. The flames, unlike the flames of his rejected mercy, don't burn him or give him pain. Rather, they burn up our sins and bring him great consolation. 
The value of placing this kindling (sinfulness, weaknesses, attachments) into the flames of his heart.
	When we produce some of this fuel, rather than get discouraged, let us repent of it and cast it into those burning flames
	May we never weary of this, for he never wearies of forgiving
>Fr. Vincent Lucia: "Like fire that transforms everything into itself ... Jesus transforms everything to good in the fire of His Divine Love, drawing good out of evil, drawing a greater good out of a greater evil, consuming even our very faults and failures (like straw thrown into a burning furnace) and using them to make us more humble and to bring us even closer to His divine Heart. 'In my weakness, I find my strength'."
###### Attachments
Going to God as we are
- "Jesus, come close to me", you should say. And know that he does. Know he pleads for you in any condition, "Come to me."
	Often he tells, "No, you're not ready to let go of those, but please just come to me, be with me, and console my Heart. Do me the kindness of holding my hand, for my Heart is filled with such sorrow."
	Our gentle, wise friend leads us up steps that are appropriate for little souls-- "little steps". One step prepares us ffor the next and next until, before we know it, such little steps brings us musch farther and higher than we ever expected to climb (Surprise! The elevator is working)
	Trust the Lord to detach, it will happen with a certain ease
	Jesus loves sincerity 


#### Fear of suffering: everything to gain
- the worst pains to his Heart is distrust, when those closest to him don't trust in him
- trust is the greatest consolation
 **The way of joyful, trustful acceptance**
- This is the Little Way of surrender, acceptance, and childlike trust. The way of joyful, trustful acceptance of God's will
	He demands no great actions, but surrender and gratitude
	- offers self to God with confidence and accepts everything with praise and thanksgiving
		- let nothing disturb us
		- further, strive to continually praise and thank God for all
	- *acceptance* is the way that we *trust* God will send us crosses that will most benefit us, and then we strive to accept them with joy
		- Efficient: God chooses our crosses
	- primacy to prayerfully being with him 
> Listen and put it into your heart, my dear little child. The thing that frightens you, the thing that afflicts you, is nothing. Do not let it disturb you. Am I not here who am your Mother? Are you not under my care and protection? Am I not the source of your joy? Are you not in the hollow of my mantle, in the crossing of my arms. Do you need something more? let nothing else worry or disturb you.

> At last, I have found some rest. My friend, I have found rest in your heart. Thank you for being with me at this hour.
- Let us be convinced that our little acts of love and trust give delight to Jesus.
	We may not always be able to hear him saying so, but we can believe that he does take delight in them.
- If we do believe it, then going to the Lord is a constant joy.
- May we find this joy always as we visit Jesus and carry him in our hearts.
- May we also realize just how powerful our going to the Lord with joyful trust really is. This seemingly little things amounts to a lot.

Consoling Jesus through trust
	Faustina as a "daughter of complete trust". 
		Jesus desires, and even needs, trusting souls in order to work his miracles of mercy in them
		In such a trusting soul, Jesus has free reign to live and work. He is free to live a life of love through it, through its deeds, words, and prayers
	Let us frequently try to distract Jesus so won't have to constantly distract us
		Give our Lord a break. Let us cheer him up, and let us do it with our trust, with our constant praise and thanks
	Where is our gaze?
		We confront the brutal facts of our current reality, but we don't stay there
		Fixating on bad news leads to evil (anger, envy, bitterness of spirit, discouragement, despair--hopelessness)
		Instead, turn to the good news, to Christ's love, and choose to love him more than before
			Others do not love Him? I am going to love him even more than before. Others do not honor him? I'm going to honor him even more than before. You said, "That must break the Lord's Heart?" Then I'm going to console him, cheer him up, praise and thank him even more than before.
	In doing so, a whole ocean of mercy will open on the world, including the ones who we love
	Jesus is not outdone in generosity. If we make efforts to console him, he'll take care of the rest. Our cares, all those dear to us, and much more than we can imagine.

#### Sensitivity of the Lord's Heart
The sensitivity of his Heart is a double-edged sword
	God chose to put a fundamental need into his own Heart when he became man, the need to give us his saving love
	Easy to console with our trust, easy to wound with our distrust
Special Marian consecration
	Consecrate self to Mary so she can form us into saints (in her role) with the Holy Spirit. 
		Lead consolation with Mary-- so that our acts of trust and love go to Jesus through the perfect consolation, the perfect faith and love, of his mother
			Even if our acts of trust are not perfect, they do not hurt Jesus because Mary's faith makes up for what we lack
So when we at least *try*... we always *do* console him.
	With our trust (even if our whole bodies shake with anxiety), when we at least try to be full of praise and thanks (even when we appear gloomy and sad), and when we at least try to remain with our friend (even if our minds are scattered directionless), then we do not need to fear hurting our Lord.
##### Marian Consecration
Today I renew an old consecration to you, Mary, my mother. I give you permission to do your work in me, as is your God-given duty. May you take my little sufferings and offerings for your Son, that you may lead me to console your Son with the perfect consolation that you provide to Him. In all that I do in love, take from me so that my offering to Our Lord may be complete and pleasing to Him.
##### Offering to Merciful Love
If Justice extends only over the earth, how much more does His Merciful Love desire to set souls on fire since His Mercy reaches to the heavens?
	The offering is simply to receive Jesus' rejected mercy, in order to relieve the suffering of Jesus. Permission to fill us with all the mercy others have rejected
		Awaken compassion in us that "Love is not loved as He ought to be loved"... a heartache to be a "victim of mercy"
	To get at the heart of what Jesus longs for: people who will let him love them completely
Reasons to live the Offering to Merciful Love:
1. it greatly consoles Jesus
2. overflows to the good of others
3. gives us a deeper sensitivity to the Lord's sorrow
##### Spiritual Communion of Merciful Love
*Ecce*
- Behold, here I am, Lord.
	(sinfulness and all. little and small.)
- "empty lungs": Behold, here I am -- without your mercy, I'll collapse and die. 
	Of course, when we present ourselves to the Lord like this, he rushes to us with his mercy, and we take a deep breath in 
*Fiat*
- Let it be done to me.
	The key to opening the heavenly floodgates of God's merciful love
- breathe in, allowing God's merciful love to flow into our emptiness
*Magnificat*
- my soul magnifies the Lord (song of praise)
	the concrete expression of trust is praise and thanksgiving
		Sometimes it comes easier at times than others
		Further, sometimes our praise will have no outward expression at all; It'll just be an act of will in the depths of our hearts
			And that's just fine with Jesus. We give him what we can, and he's happy with that
- after we "inhale" God's merciful love, because it was so good and refreshing, we'll "need" to praise and thank him for the gift of his mercy
	An exhaled magnificat
If we live this attitude of presenting our wretchedness to the Lord (ecce), receiving his mercy (fiat), and then praising and thanking him for his saving mercy (magnificat),  we can be assured we won't be seriously wounding the Lord by our lack of trust-- for trust is not only praise and thanks, it's also to recieve God's mercy
	to present as you are (ecce) and to receive God's mercy (fiat) are both acts of trust, leading to a further act of trust, namely, praise and thanks (magnificat)

#### Insensitivity of our hearts
A hard heart is the opposite of mercy[^1]
	Insensitivity is the *primary sin of man* against God and neighbor
	Separates us from God, is the loss of our humanity, and causes so much suffering
	"It is also that which brought Jesus to the Cross and caused his death -- it is that which crucified him! Only the love of God that reaches as far as the Cross can open a  breach in our hardened hearts."
- Temptations of a hard heart: an ice-cold stream of disappointments, misunderstandings, and various hurts === to close your heart to others
	- the root problem of the "culture of death" is the hardening of hearts
		- Hearts died before people did
		- consumer culture causes *heart* attacks--the kind that makes us incapable of love and causes spiritual death
Becoming sensitive to the suffering of our neighbor
- meditating on the Passion, the human event of the most suffering to the most lovable being, the greatest suffering and the greatest love, can evoke our compassion more than anything else
- to do so has the effect of:
	1. consoling Jesus ("first thing")
	2. enables our hearts to see the sufferings of others better and then be moved by their sufferings
- compassion-in-action produces deeper compassion
- not only what soften hearts (go to Jesus and reach out to others) but also to leave what harden hearts (sin)
	- Examen
##### Reaching out to our neighbor to help alleviate suffering
- A firehose of strong force, but mists with little impact; spectacle of softness, mocked by spectators and embarrasses/confuses/offends people intended to serve
	Virtue of ***prudence***: teaches how to reach out to neighbor in ways that are effective (not all lover the place) and truly consoling (not embarrassing/offensive/confusing)
	3 exercises in mercy towards neighbor:
	1. by deed
	2. by word
	3. by prayer
	- "In these degrees is contained the fullness of mercy, and it is an unquestionable proof of love for Me. By this means a soul glorifies and pays reverence to My mercy."[^2]
		These degrees are carried in that order: acts of mercy; if cannot carry out a work, then assist by my words; if I cannot show mercy by deeds or words, I can always do so by prayer. "My prayer reaches out even there when I cannot reach out physically."
- Asking the Holy Spirit to enlighten us with inspurations on how to act in everyday situations with prudent compassion ("infused prudence")
	Faustina would call the Holy Spirit by its name, "Love". She writes, "When I hesitate on how to act in some situations, I always ask Love. It advises best."
###### Reflecting on the 3 degrees of mercy
- Mercy in Deed: The ***Merciful Outlook***
	- For those who have given up on Jesus, he hasn't given up on them but goes to them incognito mode (through you and me). Jesus wants to love them through the way we look at them, through our merciful outlook
		They probs won't immediately recognize it's Jesus behind such
	- merciful outlook responds to suffering; the compassionate response to the most universal and deepest human suffering, namely, existential loneliness
		- distraction, or, to be in communion in his Family of Love
			- Christ in Word and Sacrament
			- communion with friends and family
		- way to give drink to the thirsty--a cup of love. "**I delight that you exist.**"
		- the member of Christ's Body *is* Christ.
			- outlook takes this seriously--take person as a unique member of Christ's Body, showing an utterly unique facet of the mystery of Christ
			- members of the Body of Christ help us to know and love Christ more
			- universal vocation to manifest by their redeemed existence a facet of the beauty of Christ in a way that no other being in the cosmos is capable of doing
			- to know and love Christ is to know and love his members
	- grateful situation
		- Christ did not have to invite us into close intimacy with himself that we become his very Body
			- "friends" (Jn 15:15)
			- "children of God" (1 Jn 3:1)
		- Thanks to the unfathomable mercy of God, this is now the way things are. By God's good pleasure and design, it *is* reality
		- Christ is now glorious not only in himself but in his members, and this doesn't take anything away from him
			- further, it helps us to appreciate him all the more not only for the superabundant mercy that created this new situation but for the amazing richness of Christ that this situation reveals
	Seeing others as God sees--seing the beauty of what he created (see Gen 1:31)
	- in an unrepentant sinner, a vocation to greatness even if entombed in a hardened heart
		- The merciful outlook draws out the good and brings back to life
		- When a sinner recognizes that God sees this greatness in him, he begins to come alive
	- the "terrible" inner eye: you are not yet who you are meant to be
		- it is not our role to see in the other what the other's own inner eye sees
			- another's conscience is a sacred space
			- judgmental outlook draws darkness out of the other and even destroy him
		-  looking at others with the judgmental outlook is to abandon our part in the Lord's patient and loving strategy
	- our responsibility lies primarily in deep-sea diving
		- rather than:
			- deal with annoying stuff, look past, or rediscover as a treasure
			- sinful stuff we leave up to the Lord and them, unless we have a clear resp to confront/correct them, in which case we need to beg Love for grace and prudence to do our duty lovingly
		- searching for treasure that we know is there: in each a facet of the face of Christ that can't be found in anyone else
			- worth diving for
			- fear not murky water (hardness of the other's heart), pay attention to sea monsters (the other's annoying personality traits). If sharks come out (meanness or signs of certain signs of inappropriateness), we do not have to stay. But little bites from other sea monsters are nothing compared to the delight that comes from finding the treasure that lies on the ocean floor
		- it is not a soft approach of "see no evil"
			- Sin and annoyance are there. We all know they're there
			- strategic choice to go past them, go for "the greater good", chooses mercy over justice and trusts in the power of mercy to bring an even greater good out of evil
	- The art of loving
		- God is pleased with the one who doesn't lose heart after embarrasing himself trying to love, when we don't give up after learning firsthand what it means to be a "fool for Christ's sake" (1 Cor 4:10)
		- cynicism and hardness of heart are not signs of prudence--but quitting, fear, buried talents, hidden light
		- high ideal, yes. And:
			- we will fail, and we will succeed, and the successes are worth the pain of failure
			- it's not possible to live perfectly, but it is possible to live
			- people really fo have an amazing beauty that comes from being the unique members of the Body of Christ that they are (or called to be). Even if we see them every day for the rest of our lives, there is no exhausting their richness
		- The Heart is the goal, sharing his Heart that always sees the treasure (and the suffering) of each person, the Heart that sees always his image in another, the pierced Heart that knows at what terrible price the other has been made so beautiful
- Merciful Word: the Merciful Question
	Well, how much time do you have?
