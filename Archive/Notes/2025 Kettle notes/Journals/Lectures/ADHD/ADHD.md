#### ADHD
##### ADHD intro module
- motivation is attached to focused attention
- this is a broader problem (environment is more conduced to rise of ADHD symptoms)
	- technology is fracturing our attention
- factors affecting our environment
- "doing stuff" is about rewards
- "doing" vs "wanting to do" (what is resistance?)
- how to set goals
	- is this dream achievable? Am I motivated to work on it or does it paralyze me?
##### motivation model
3 components:
- intents (why is this a goal for me?)
	- does this goal lie outside myself? if so you don't care about it
	- Should vs do
	- Is this a genuine desire from within me?
- resistance
	- [[resistance from emotions]]
		- goals are logical in nature
		- emotional blockage
	- [[identity (ahamkara)]]
		- If I am XXXX, what does that mean for my chance of success?
		- identity can hold us back
		- we won't do things that we think we will fail
- action
	- getting started
	- breaking abstract tasks into good goals, operationalizing tasks
	- cultivating environment to do tasks
	- healthy technology hygiene
Diagnosing: 
- why am I not motivated?
- motivation is an individual factor-- what applies to me?
- finding the stoppage point
##### perspectives on ADHD

	- hunters vs farmers (cognitive types)
		- genetics: 
			- ADHD is heritable
			- hunter societies had more ADHD genes than gatherer societies
			- 35,000 yrs, negative selection for ADHD genes
	- diagnosis is environment is dependent
		- schools w less favorable student:teacher ratios, more likely to find ADHD
		- more structure to teacher where ADHD is not a problem
- some environments are more conducive to individual's success
