Idealistic procrastination (perfectionist procrastination)
- a guaranteed fail rather than likely chance to do something poorly
	- *Ego problem*. When you can do something perfectly, no one can criticize you
		- "We are going to be awesome or we are not going to do it at all"
		- Compensate, ego
- "not ready, it's not perfect"
	- *protection from failure*. To not deal with the consequences of not being ready.
		- "Be the best, or not compete at all"
	- **Solution**: **be OK with not being perfect.** 
		- 1: What's better for you in the long run?
		- Tunnel down into that-- (and you will see the foundations of perfection are weak)
			- Attach ourselves to a fantasy of being perfect
			- 2: What it would mean to our identity? What would it mean to ourselves if I were able to do it perfect? How would I feel about myself? Why is that so important to me? Why can't I afford to be less than perfect. 
Avoidance procrastination
- *Emotional problem*. 
- The procrastination tends to be avoiding negative emotions.
- Tunnel down into the emotion, emotional digestion and awareness
	- NOTE: we don't ask WHY we are procrastinating. Never seek to understand, ONLY seek to change.
	- Ask, **what are we seeking to avoid?**
		- What consequence are we trying to avoid? What emotion are we trying to avoid?
		- NOTE: awareness makes behaving easier
Operational procrastination
- Don't engage bc brain can't figure out *how to do it*
- Thoughts for a chemistry test (what kind of thoughts correlate with getting an A on a chemistry test?)
	- "I want to get an A" == 3.6
	- "I need to study for chemistry test" == 3.6
	- "I am going to study chemistry at 5PM" == .65
		- **Implementation** thought. Not goals, but IMPLEMENTATION orientation -- what, where, how?
- Getting overwhelmed! Where do you start?
- Operationalize the problem, break things down
	- SMART goals
	- Gantt chart
	- What's the last thing that you do? Walk backwards.
		- Get the job, negotiate a job offer, interview for a job (get outfit, get ready, be ready), be offered an interview, apply for a job (how? Ask a friend, reach out to alumni network, apply online, get a resume), write a resume (...)
		- Which do you want to do on Wednesday? What can i do right now? 
			- Not just FIND A JOB, but on Tuesday we can do...
