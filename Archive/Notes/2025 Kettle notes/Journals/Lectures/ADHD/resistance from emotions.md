POSIT: bigger consequence === more motivated to address it
- RATHER: so motivated to make all the problems go away, that we *escape*

**Emotions drive behavior
- emotions are "override switch" for logic in behavior
- Lack of motivation
	- experienced as neutral, bc distraction evoked to protect us
		- "I can't bring myself to do it"
		- "What if {irrational fear} happens?"
		- "I'm tired." (and such excuses for not doing)
	- if you sit with emotion attached to behavior, find subsurface frustration, panic, fear of rejection, shame, etc.
