*what are features of a smart kid? smart kids don't work hard.*
*implications, what if we run into something that requires effort.*
*stop doing things that are hard, that made you feel not smart. i'm a smart kid! I'm just lazy.*
*narrowing identity to this single aspect. restricted identity, preserving it fiercely.*

#### Vedic parts of mind
- **Manas**: emotional, reactive. Generates preferences.
- **Ahamkara**: identity, protector, ego. Bouncer of the mind to keep us safe.
	- Fundamentally comparative in nature
- **Buddhi**: intellect, logical.
	- at odds with the ahamkara. If identity is X, then buddhi will ignore all logic that suggest I am not-X
- **Samskara**: cognitive-emotional impressions 

#### Ahamkara function
- Mind treats self-perception as a fact, a truth to base life around
	- Ahamkara seeks to protect identity, sometimes at all costs
	- Shapes perception, self-perception, actions.
		- A filter (cognitive bias)
		- Leans towards confirmation bias
- PROBLEM: everything in our mind and attributes of identity are NOT facts
	- Much resistance comes from ahamkara
		Forms of avoidance
		- *to preserve sense of identity* (avoid negative emotions)
		- *to prevent formation of another identity* (fear of identity becoming true; will never get info, take chance to confirm it)
- IDENTIFY: If you have goals but are confused on why we can't do them/avoidance, don't know why

#### Address
- Meditation
	- **Ego meditation.** "Who am I?" meditation, finding the origin in the answer == abstract concept formed of thoughts and memories pieced together; but not truly who you are.
- Ask questions (not about the action/task, but the identity)
	- ...what does this say about me as a person?
		- If I try to engage in this behavior and it works...
		- If I try to engage in this behavior and it DOESN'T work...
		- If I DON'T engage in this behavior, what hope does that keep alive in myself?
