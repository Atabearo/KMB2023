Effect Measure Modification

Exogenous variable = confounding

Multicausality

## Interaction/Effect Modification

Interaction: X+Y is greater than the effect of X and of Y individually, combined
Effect Modification: The effect of X on result is greater among people with Y compared to those with people with no Y 
- The effect of T on O is different in the presence/absence of E

- E is NOT associated with T (in this RCT, E is randomized)

Additive scale (measuring absolute/attributable risks)
- Additive effect modification
- MORE relevant to public health bc RR can be decieving
Relative scale
- Multiplicative scale (measuing relative risks)
- Multiplicative effect modification

## Mediators
Mediators are typically proxies that we intervene on in public health
#### Types
Full
- Completely mediated due to M
Partial
- Effect is independently associated, but not as large without M
