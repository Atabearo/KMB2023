### Internal validity
The extent to which the observed effect is due to intervention
##### Threats to internal validity
**Maturation**: subjects change over time, effects on dependent variable may be due to an age effect
- more likely in children
- in longitudinal studies
**History**: external events that may influence the dependent variable
**Testing:** testing (or practice) may create a learning effect
**Instrument accuracy**
**Selection Bias**
**Experimental Mortality**: potential systematic loss of subjects

### External validity
Direct relationship with the ability to generalize
