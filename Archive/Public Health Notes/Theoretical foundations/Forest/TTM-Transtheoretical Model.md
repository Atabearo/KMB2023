The *what, when, and how* of behavior change. 
#### What: stages of change in behavior
Getting to *thinking* about it (precontemplation, contemplation), *acting* on it (preparation, action), and *continuing* into the future (maintenance and [[termination]]).
#### How: processes of change

###### Initial processes
- **Consciousness raising:** increased insight on behavior/condition
- **Dramatic relief**: Emotional catharsis, emotional relief after behavior modified
###### Evaluation 
includes *[[self-reevaluation]]* (what would my life be like without behavior?) and *environmental re-evaluation* (how do my behaviors effect others?)
###### Modifying [[cues to action]]
- **Self-liberation** is the sense an individual has the potential to commit to changing (see [[self efficacy]]). *Occurs* like event-based [[cues to action]] ("fresh start effect", temporal landmarks to set new goals such as Mondays or New Year's Day).
- **Stimulus control** is *avoiding* bad *[[cues to action]]* and subbing new ones
###### Action and maintenance
- **Counterconditioning** is *substitution* of good *behaviors* for bad ones. 
- **[[Contingency management]]**
- **Social liberation/Helping relationships** is having social interactions that facilitate goal attainment

#### When: levels of change

Sometimes the progression of change is clear for behavioral problems (ex: walking, smoking, drinking) but not for complex problems (situational problems, maladaptive thinking, interpersonal problems, family conflict).

- **[[Decision balance]]**
- [[self efficacy]]
### Pros/Cons
Pros
- behavior change specific
Cons
- stages are arbitrary, can move from one stage to another very quickly
- does not inform factors behind behavior change
