### Dump:

4/14
- Run and impromptu Bible study? Pick something you want to share 
	- Face to face
	- Trust
- What to say?
	- ***Claim/req:*** You're very close to my heart and I want to relate to you in a way that I can express that.
		- (between restrained and at times overwhelmed or abusing the found family trope for the bit, I rather be funny)
		- ***C:*** love like God
			- ***E:*** pure-hearted and flexible 
			- Bible: God's love is gentle and flexible
				- See here, that not all intimacy is romantic
				- marry only one person
			- Luis: in love, cannot be friends
				- ***CER***: Want to be able to support you unconditionally. 
		- ***R:*** God love is expansive, sufficiency but abundance in other relationships
- (Kind of intense)
	- ***Claim:*** Closest to loving someone like God and learned about how God loves
		- Learned a lot about how to relate to God in how you are a steadfast friend to me
			- Presence; even when I am unsure (regardless of my intellect and reason, and what I feel), I can choose to trust what you told me
	- ***R:*** Loving God helps me love you, and loving you helps me love God
