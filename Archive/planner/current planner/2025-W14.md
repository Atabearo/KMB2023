### Thought dump
4/4
Known knowns: he wore a Spy Family shirt today and let me paint his nails. He loves them.
Known unknowns: he seemed to avert his gaze sometimes, and asked me to not force it. He put on a volleyball game after a while.
Unknown unknowns: is he also acutely aware where I am? Does he think me restrained?

3/31
Intents:
- Do a good job in data collection
- Listen to those around me
- If possible, talk about my future plans
