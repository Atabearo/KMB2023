### journal
As much as I wanted to write a note meant to strike his heart with yearning, I think if possible (and it is) that this kind of message would not be appropriate for my purposes of being a good and faithful friend. I rather tell it to him at a time when our relationship is at that point of disclosure; it is a fool's work to tell the right story at the wrong time.

If love is willing the good of the other, he truly did love me in that rejection. I wasn't ready for a relationship, that's obvious. My body language was always on the defensive. I was not in a position to give myself freely nor totally, and I want someone to love him the way God loves him. 

I also wanted to reflect here. I said I loved (eros) him and still wanted to be friends anyway because he was special (storge) to me, and I meant that truly. 
	Deep affection (storge) for this boy. Even if we don't talk about each other (eros) in that same way again, it seems we are bound by so many things to talk about and can run with each other (philia). I leave it in God's hands and as it always has, a shared decision in his hands, too.

I liked it, but looking back it was a really silly that he called me by that nickname.
