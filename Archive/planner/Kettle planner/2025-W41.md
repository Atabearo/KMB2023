To be a companion isn't anything grand, it is in the walking side-by-side. You share in life and take in things together, understanding each other's pains and joys. You get to know their likes and dislikes, their peculiarities and interests, and learn to respond to them uniquely. 
To be a partner is a committed companion.

He appreciates who I am. I know he is trustworthy, and patient with me. He also thinks of me to reach out. We know we are similar to another in faith, values, ambitions, and even superficial interests. We have similar hearts.
I believe it is clear that the appreciation is reciprocal, and that I also think of him to reach out. If there is any doubt he perceives, it's the question whether I am the best person to be involved in any aspect of his life. This occurred with the inception of writing group and with my attempt to direct him to Madelene for the med school search.
When this happens, he affirms that, to him, whatever I offer is enough and who I am is sufficient for the purpose. It's a gesture that says "I want to do this together." 

*It didn't have to be you and you may not be "perfect" for it. But I want to do this with you.*

So we will write, and look at med schools together, and we have and always will have shared so much to be special to each other.
I do not assume that we will ever be life partners. In the end, my greatest desire for him is that he has the best out there, all that God has planned for him.
