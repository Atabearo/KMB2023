On the genocide in Gaza
	I know better than that to say that yes--baby formula and immediate need is so important, but so is the work it takes to prevent aggression and genocide in the first place. Can you not see the brokenness of their once-homes, the starving bodies, the burning and shot down? I can see clearly now, those who have always seen the suffering of the Ukranian and Gazan people and never had that option to look away. I see the early advocates, even among my friends, who have long stood for these people and their right to live in a world that supports them. Even the establishment is only now turning their heads and their stories break our nightly TV news, but this was not so, even to a few months ago. The advocates are growing a build their pressure. Even those who had the luxury to turn away cannot ignore this now. The intensification of conflict been going on for almost 2 years now. 
	I have the privilege to cry and choose to forget. But to forget, would that not betray my beloved friend who calls my life calls to be merciful in deed, word, and prayer? What power I do not have make massive influence, I can still use as my small offering for my neighbors across the world. Some have that power, and should they not be held accountable for supporting weapon aid to the aggressors? Can I not even ask these questions, though they place a burden on me? Will I not wish I had done more? Where I am now, I may be quiet, but I will not be silent.
